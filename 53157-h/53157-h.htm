<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The following narrative gathers itself round
what is, perhaps, one of the most absorbing
and difficult problems of our age; the problem
namely of getting to the bottom of that world-old
struggle between the “well-constituted” and the “ill-constituted,”
which the writings of Nietzsche have
recently called so startlingly to our attention.</p>

<p>Is there such a thing at all as Nietzsche’s born and
trained aristocracy? In other words, is the secret
of the universe to be reached only along the lines of
Power, Courage, and Pride? Or,&mdash;on the contrary,&mdash;is
the hidden and basic law of things, not Power
but Sacrifice, not Pride but Love?</p>

<p>Granting, for the moment, that this latter alternative
is the true one, what becomes of the drastic
distinction between “well-constituted” and “ill-constituted”?</p>

<p>In a universe whose secret is not self-assertion, but
self-abandonment, might not the “well-constituted”
be regarded as the vanquished, and the “ill-constituted”
as the victors? In other words, who, in such
a universe, <em>are</em> the “well-constituted”?</p>

<p>But the difficulty does not end here. Supposing we
rule out of our calculation both of these antipodal
possibilities,&mdash;both the universe whose inner fatality
is the striving towards Power, and the universe whose
inner fatality is the striving towards Love,&mdash;will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
there not be found to remain two other rational
hypotheses, either, namely, that there is no inner
fatality about it at all, that the whole thing is a
blind, fantastic, chance-drifting chaos; or that the
true secret lies in some subtle and difficult reconciliation,
between the will to Power and the will to
Love?</p>

<p>The present chronicle is an attempt to give an
answer, inevitably a very tentative one, to this
formidable question; the writer, feeling that, as in
all these matters, where the elusiveness of human
nature plays so prominent a part, there is more hope
of approaching the truth, indirectly, and by means of
the imaginative mirror of art, than directly, and by
means of rational theorizing.</p>

<p>The whole question is indeed so intimately associated
with the actual panorama of life and the
evasive caprices of flesh and blood, that every kind
of drastic and clinching formula breaks down under
its pressure.</p>

<p>Art, alone,&mdash;that mysterious daughter of Life,&mdash;has
the secret of following the incalculable movements
of the Force to which she is so near akin. A
story which grossly points its moral with fixed indicative
finger is a story which, in the very strain of
that premature articulation, has lost the magic of
its probability. The secret of our days flies from
our attempts at making it fit such clumsy categories,
and the maddening flavour of the cosmic cup refuses
to be imprisoned in any laboratory.</p>

<p>At this particular moment in the history of our
planet it is above all important to protest against
this prostituting of art to pseudo-science. It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
not be allowed to these hasty philosophical conclusions
and spasmodic ethical systems, to block up and
close in, as they are so ready to do, the large free
horizons of humour and poetry. The magic of the
World, mocking both our gravity and our flippancy,
withdraws itself from our shrewd rationalizations, only
to take refuge all the deeper in our intrinsic and
evasive hearts.</p>

<p>In this story the author has been led to interest
himself in the curious labyrinthine subtleties
which mark the difference,&mdash;a difference to be observed
in actual life, quite apart from moral values,&mdash;between
the type of person who might be regarded
as born to rule, and the type of person who might
be regarded as born to be ruled over. The grand
Nietzschean distinction is, in a sense, rejected here
upon its own ground, a ground often inconsequently
deserted by those who make it their business to condemn
it. Such persons are apt to forget that the
whole assumption of this distinction lies in a substitution
of <em>æsthetic</em> values, for the values more commonly
applied.</p>

<p>The pivotal point of the ensuing narrative might
be described as an attempt to suggest, granting such
an æsthetic test, that the hearts of “ill-constituted”
persons,&mdash;the hearts of slaves, Pariahs, cowards,
outcasts, and other victims of fate,&mdash;may be at
least as <em>interesting</em>, in their bizarre convolutions, as
the hearts of the bravest and gayest among us. And
<em>interest</em>, after all, is the supreme exigency of the
æsthetic sense!</p>

<p>In order to thrust back from its free horizons these
invasions of its prerogatives by alien powers, Art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
must prove itself able to evoke the very tang and
salt and bitter-sweetness of the actual pell-mell of
life&mdash;its unfolding spaces, its shell-strewn depths.
She must defend herself from those insidious traitors
in her own camp who would betray her into the hands
of the system-makers, by proving that she can approach
nearer to the magic of the world, without a
system, than all these are able to do, with all of
theirs! She must keep the horizons open&mdash;that must
be her main concern. She must hold fast to poetry
and humour, and about her creations there must be
a certain spirit of <em>liberation</em>, and the presence of
large tolerant after-thoughts.</p>

<p>The curious thing about so many modern writers
is, that in their earnest preoccupation with philosophical
and social problems, they grow strained and
thin and sententious, losing the mass and volume, as
well as the elusive-blown airs, of the flowing tide.
On the other hand there is an irritating tendency,
among some of the cleverest, to recover their lost
balance after these dogmatic speculations, by foolish
indulgence in sheer burlesque&mdash;burlesque which is
the antithesis of all true humour.</p>

<p>Heaven help us! It is easy enough to criticize
the lath and plaster which, in so many books, takes
the place of flesh and blood. It is less easy to catch,
for oneself, the breath of the ineffable spirit!</p>

<p>Perhaps the deplorable thinness and sententiousness,
to which reference has been made, may be due to
the fact that in the excitement of modern controversy,
our enterprising writers have no time to read.
It is a strange thing, but one really feels as though,
among all modern English authors, the only one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
brings with him an atmosphere of the large mellow
leisurely humanists of the past,&mdash;of the true classics,
in fact,&mdash;is Mr. Thomas Hardy.</p>

<p>It is for this reason, for the reason that with this
great genius, life is approached in the old ample
ironic way, that the narrator of the following tale
has taken the liberty of putting Mr. Hardy’s name
upon his title-page. In any case mere courtesy and
decency called for such a recognition. One could
hardly have the audacity to plant one’s poor standard
in the heart of Wessex without obeisance being paid
to the literary over-lord of that suggestive region.</p>

<p>It must be understood, however, that the temerity
of the author does not carry him so far as to regard
his eccentric story as in any sense an attempted
imitation of the Wessex novelist. Mr. Hardy cannot
be imitated. The mention of his admirable name at
the beginning of this book is no more than a humble
salutation addressed to the monarch of that particular
country, by a wayward nomad, lighting a
bivouac-fire, for a brief moment, in the heart of a
land that is not his.</p>

<h1>WOOD AND STONE</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">LEO’S HILL</span></h2>

<p>Midway between Glastonbury and Bridport,
at the point where the eastern plains
of Somersetshire merge into the western
valleys of Dorsetshire, stands a prominent and
noticeable hill; a hill resembling the figure of a
crouching lion.</p>

<p>East of the hill, nestling at the base of a cone-shaped
eminence overgrown with trees and topped
by a thin Thyrsus-like tower, lies the village of
Nevilton.</p>

<p>Were it not for the neighbourhood of the more
massive promontory this conical protuberance would
itself have stood out as an emphatic landmark;
but Leo’s Hill detracts from its emphasis, as it
detracts from the emphasis of all other deviations
from the sea-level, between Yeoborough and the
foot of the Quantocks.</p>

<p>It was on the apex of Nevilton Mount that the
Holy Rood of Waltham was first found; but with
whatever spiritual influence this event may have endowed
the gentler summit, it is not to it, but to
Leo’s Hill, that the lives and destinies of the people
of Nevilton have come to gravitate. One might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
indeed without difficulty conceive of a strange
supernatural conflict going on between the consecrated
repository of Christian tradition guarding its
little flock, and the impious heathen fortress to which
day by day that flock is driven, to seek their material
sustenance.</p>

<p>Even in Pre-Celtic times those formidably dug
trenches and frowning slopes must have looked down
on the surrounding valley; and to this day it is the
same suggestion of tyrannical military dominance,
which, in spite of quarries and cranes and fragrant
yellow gorse, gives the place its prevailing character.</p>

<p>The rounded escarpments have for centuries been
covered with pleasant turf and browsed upon by
sheep; but patient antiquarian research constantly
brings to light its coins, torques, urns, arrow-heads,
amulets; and rumour hints that yet more precious
things lie concealed under those grassy mounds.</p>

<p>The aboriginal tribes have been succeeded by the
Celt; the Celt by the Roman; the Roman by the
Saxon; without any change in the place’s inherent
character, and without any lessening of its tyranny
over the surrounding country. For though Leo’s
Hill dominates no longer by means of its external
strength, it dominates, quite as completely, by means
of its interior riches.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, a huge rock-island, washed by the
leafy waves of the encircling valleys, and containing,
as its hid treasure, stone enough to rebuild
Babylon.</p>

<p>In that particular corner of the West Country, so
distinct and deep-rooted are the legendary survivals,
it is hard not to feel as though some vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
spiritual conflict were still proceeding between the
two opposed Mythologies&mdash;the one drawing its
strength from the impulse to Power, and the other
from the impulse to Sacrifice.</p>

<p>A village-dweller in Nevilton might, if he were
philosophically disposed, be just as much a percipient
of this cosmic struggle, as if he stood between the
Palatine and St. Peter’s.</p>

<p>Let him linger among the cranes and pulleys of
this heathen promontory, and look westward to the
shrine of the Holy Grail, or eastward to where
rested the Holy Rood, and it would be strange if he
did not become conscious of the presence of eternal
spiritual antagonists, wrestling for the mastery.</p>

<p>He would at any rate be made aware of the fatal
force of Inanimate Objects over human destiny.</p>

<p>There would seem to him something positively
monstrous and sinister about the manner in which
this brute mass of inert sandstone had possessed
itself of the lives of the generations. It had come
to this at last; that those who owned the Hill
owned the dwellers beneath the Hill; and the Hill
itself owned them that owned it.</p>

<p>The name by which the thing had come to be
known indicated sufficiently well its nature.</p>

<p>Like a couchant desert-lion it overlooked its prey;
and would continue to do so, as long as the planet
lasted.</p>

<p>Out of its inexhaustible bowels the tawny monster
fed the cities of seven countries&mdash;cities whose halls,
churches, theatres, and markets, mocked the caprices
of rain and sun as obdurately as their earth-bound
parent herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The sandstone of Leo’s Hill remains, so architects
tell us, the only rival of granite, as a means for the
perpetuation of human monuments. Even granite
wears less well than this, in respect to the assaults of
rain and flood. The solitary mysterious monoliths
of Stonehenge, with their unknown, alien origin, alone
seem to surpass it in their eternal perdurance.</p>

<p>As far as Nevilton itself is concerned everything in
the place owes its persuasive texture to this resistant
yet soft material. From the lordly Elizabethan mansion
to the humblest pig-stye, they all proceed from
the entrails of Leo’s Hill; and they all still wear&mdash;these
motley whelps of the great dumb beast&mdash;its
tawny skin, its malleable sturdiness, its enduring
consistence.</p>

<p>Who can resist a momentary wonder at the strange
mutability of the fate that governs these things?
The actual slabs, for example, out of which the high
shafts and slender pinnacles of the church-tower were
originally hewn, must once have lain in littered heaps
for children to scramble upon, and dogs to rub
against. And now they are the windy resting-places,
and airy “coigns of vantage,” of all the feathered
tribes in their migrations!</p>

<p>What especially separates the Stone of Leo’s Hill
from its various local rivals, is its chameleon-like
power of taking tone and colour from every element
it touches. While Purbeck marble, for instance,
must always remain the same dark, opaque, slippery
thing it was when it left its Dorset coast; while
Portland stone can do nothing but grow gloomier
and gloomier, in its ashen-grey moroseness, under the
weight of the London fogs; the tawny progeny of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
this tyrant of the western vales becomes amber-streaked
when it restricts the play of fountains,
orange-tinted when it protects herbacious borders,
and rich as a petrified sunset when it drinks the
evening light from the mellow front of a Cathedral
Tower.</p>

<p>Apart from any geological affinity, it might almost
seem as though this Leonian stone possessed some
weird occult relation to those deep alluvial deposits
which render the lanes and fields about Nevilton so
thick with heavy earth.</p>

<p>Though closer in its texture to sand than to clay,
it is with clay that its local usage is more generally
associated, and it is into a clay-bed that it crumbles
at last, when the earth retakes her own. Its prevailing
colour is rather the colour of clay than of sand,
and no material that could be found could lend itself
more congruously to the clinging consistence of a
clay floor.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to conceive of a temple of
marble or Portland stone rising out of the embrace
of the thick Nevilton soil. But Leonian sandstone
seems no more than a concentrated petrifaction of
such soil&mdash;its natural evocation, its organic expression.
The soil calls out upon it day and night with
friendly recognition, and day and night it answers the
call. There is thus no escape for the human victims
of these two accomplices. In confederate reciprocity
the stone receives them from the clay, and the clay
receives them from the stone. They pass from homes
built irretrievably of the one, into smaller and more
permanent houses, dug irretrievably out of the other.</p>

<p>The character of the soil in that corner of Somersetshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
is marked, beyond everything else, by the clinging
tenacity of its soft, damp, treacherous earth.
It is a spot loved by the west-wind, and by the rains
brought by the west-wind. Overshadowed by the
lavish fertility of its abounding foliage, it never seems
to experience enough sunshine to draw out of it the
eternal presence of this oppressive dampness. The
lush pastures may thicken, the rich gardens blossom,
the ancient orchards ripen; but an enduring sense of
something depressing and deep and treacherous lurks
ever in the background of these pleasant things.
Not a field but has its overshadowing trees; and not
a tree but has its roots loosely buried in that special
kind of soft, heavy earth, which an hour’s rain can
change into clinging mud.</p>

<p>It is in the Nevilton churchyard, when a new
grave is being dug, that this sinister peculiarity of
the earth-floor is especially noticeable. The sight of
those raw, rough heaps of yellow clay, tossed out
upon grass and flowers, is enough to make the living
shrink back in terror from the oblong hole into which
they have consigned their dead. All human cemeteries
smell, like the hands of the Shakespearean king,
of forlorn mortality; but such mortality seems more
palpably, more oppressively emphasized among the
graves of Nevilton than in other repositories of the
dead. To be buried in many a burying-ground one
knows, would be no more than a negative terror; no
more than to be deprived, as Homer puts it, of the
sweet privilege of the blessed air. But to be buried
in Nevilton clay has a positive element in its dreadfulness.
It is not so much to be buried, as to be
sucked in, drawn down, devoured, absorbed. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in any place does the peculiar congruity between the
yellowness of the local clay and the yellowness of the
local stone show so luridly as among these patient
hillocks.</p>

<p>The tombstones here do not relieve the pressure of
fate by appealing, in marble whiteness, away from
the anthropophagous earth, to the free clouds of
heaven. They are of the earth, and they conspire
with the earth. They yearn to the soil, and the soil
yearns to them. They weigh down upon the poor
relics consigned to their care, in a hideous partnership
with the clay that is working its will upon them.</p>

<p>And the rank vegetation of the place assists
this treachery. Orange-tinted lichen and rusty-red
weather-stains alternate with the encroachments of
moss and weeds in reducing each separate protruding
slab into conformity with what is about it and beneath
it. This churchyard, whose stone and clay
so cunningly intermingle, is in an intimate sense the
very navel and centre of the village. Above it rises
the tall perpendicular tower of St. Catharine’s church;
and beyond it, on the further side of a strip of pasture,
a stagnant pond, and a solitary sycamore, stands the
farm that is locally named “the Priory.” This
house, the most imposing of all in the village except
the Manor, has as its immediate background the
umbrageous conical eminence where the Holy Rood
was found. It is a place adapted to modern usage
from a noble fragment of monastic ruin. Here, in
mediæval days, rose a rich Cistercian abbey, to which,
doubtless, the pyramidal mount, in the background,
offered a store of consecrated legends.</p>

<p>North of the churchyard, beyond the main village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
street with its formal town-like compactness, the
ground slopes imperceptibly up, past a few enclosed
cottage-orchards, to where, embosomed in gracious
trees and Italianated gardens, stands the pride and
glory of Nevilton, its stately Elizabethan house.</p>

<p>This house, founded in the reign of Henry VIII,
synchronized in its foundation with the overthrow of
the Cistercian Order, and was constructed entirely
of Leonian stone, removed for the purpose of building
it from the scene of the Priory’s destruction. Twice
over, then, in their human history, since they left
the entrails of that brooding monster over which the
Nevilton people see the sun set each day, had these
carved pieces of sandstone contributed to the pride
of the rulers of men.</p>

<p>Their first use had not been attended with an
altogether propitious destiny. How far their present
use will prove of happier omen remains a secret of
the adamantine Fates. The imaginary weaving of
events, upon which we are just now engaged, may
perhaps serve, as certain liturgical formulæ of propitiation
served in former days, as a means of averting
the wrath of the Eumenides. For though made use
of again and again for fair and pious purposes, something
of the old heathen malignity of the Druid hill
still seems to hang about the stone it yields; and over
the substance of that stone’s destiny the two Mythologies
still struggle; Power and Sacrifice dividing the
living and the dead.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">NEVILTON</span></h2>

<p>Until within some twenty years of the date
with which we are now concerned, the distinguished
family who originally received the
monastic estates from the royal despot had held
them intact and unassailed. By an evil chance however,
the property had extended itself, during the
eighteenth century, so as to include the larger portion
of Leo’s Hill; and since that day its possession had
been attended by misfortune. The ancient aboriginal
fortress proved as fatal to its modern invaders as it
had proved in remoter times to Roman, Saxon and
Norman.</p>

<p>A fanciful imagination might indeed have amused
itself with the curious dream, that some weird Druidic
curse had been laid upon that grass-grown island of
yellow rock, bringing disaster and eclipse to all who
meddled with it. Such an imagination would have
been able to fortify its fancy by recalling the suggestive
fact that at the bottom of the large woodland
pond, indicated in this narrative under the name of
Auber Lake, was discovered, not many years before,
an immense slab of Leonian stone, inscribed with
symbols baffling interpretation, but suggesting, to one
antiquarian mind at least, a hint of prehistoric Devil-Worship.
However this may be, it is certain that
the family of Seldom found themselves finally faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
with the alternative of selling the place they loved or
of seeing it lapse under their hands into confusion
and neglect. Of these evil alternatives they chose the
former; and thus the estates, properties, royalties,
and appurtenances, of the historic Manor of Nevilton
fell into the hands of a clever financier from Lombard
Street.</p>

<p>The family of Mr. Mortimer Romer had never at
any time bowed its knee in kings’ houses. Nor were
its religious antecedents marked by orthodox reputation.
Mr. Romer was indeed in every sense of the
word a “self-made man.” But though neither Christian
nor Jew,&mdash;for his grandfather, the fish-monger
of Soho, had been of the Unitarian persuasion&mdash;it
cannot be denied that he possessed the art of making
himself thoroughly respected by both the baptized
and the circumcised. He indeed pursued his main
purpose, which was the acquiring of power, with
an unscrupulousness worthy of a Roman Emperor.
Possibly it was this Roman tenacity in him, combined
with his heathen indifference to current theology,
which propitiated the avenging deities of Leo’s Hill.
So far at any rate he had been eminently successful
in his speculations. He had secured complete possession
of every quarry on the formidable eminence;
and the company of which he was both director and
president was pursuing its activities in a hundred new
directions. It had, in the few last years, gone so far
as to begin certain engineering assaults upon those
remote portions of the ancient escarpments that had
been left untouched since the legions of Claudius
Cæsar encamped under their protection.</p>

<p>The bulk of Mr. Romer’s stone-works were on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Hill itself; but others, intended for the more delicate
finishing touches, were situated in a convenient spot
close to Nevilton Station. Out of these sheds and
yards, built along the railway-track, arose, from
morning to night, the monotonous, not unpleasing,
murmur of wheels and saws and grindstones. The
contrast between these sounds and the sylvan quietness
of the vicarage garden, which sloped down
towards them, was one of the most significant indications
of the clash of the Two Mythologies in this
place. The priest meditating among his roses upon
the vanity of all but “heavenly habitations” might
have been in danger of being too obtrusively reminded
of the pride of the houses that are very definitely
“made with hands.” Perhaps this was one of the
reasons why the present incumbent of Nevilton had
preferred a more undisturbed retreat.</p>

<p>The general manager of Mortimer Romer’s quarries
was a certain Mr. Lickwit, who served also as his
confidential adviser in many other spheres.</p>

<p>The works at Nevilton Station were left to the
superintendence of two brothers named Andersen,
skilled stone-cutters, sons of the famous Gideon
Andersen known to architects all over the kingdom
for his designs in Leonian stone. Both Gideon
and his wife Naomi were buried in Nevilton churchyard,
and the brothers were condemned in the
village as persons of an almost scandalous piety
because of their innocent habit of lingering on warm
summer evenings over their parents’ grave. They
lived together, these two, as lodgers with the station-master,
in a newly built cottage close to their work.
Their social position in the place was a curious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
anomalous one. Their father’s reputation as a sculptor
had brought him into touch with every grade of
society; and the woman who became his wife was by
birth what is usually termed a lady. Gideon himself
had been a rough and gross fellow; and after his
wife’s death had hastened to take his sons away from
school and apprentice them to his own trade. They
were in many respects a noteworthy pair, though
scarcely favourites, either with their fellow-workmen
or their manager.</p>

<p>James Andersen, the elder by some ten years, was
of a morose, reserved temper, and though a capable
workman never seemed happy in the work-shop.
Luke, on the contrary, possessed a peculiarly sunny
and serene spirit.</p>

<p>They were both striking in appearance. The
younger approximated to that conventional type of
beauty which is popularly known as being “like a
Greek god.” The elder, tall, swarthy, and sinister,
suggested rather the image of some gloomy idol
carved on the wall of an Assyrian temple. What,
however, was much more remarkable than their
appearance was their devoted attachment to one
another. They lived, worked, ate, drank, walked
and slept together. It was impossible to separate
them. Had Mr. Lickwit dismissed James, Luke would
immediately have thrown down his tools. Had
Luke been the banished one, James would have
followed him into exile.</p>

<p>It had fallen to Mr. Romer, some seven years
before our narrative begins, to appoint a new vicar
to Nevilton; and he had appointed one of such
fierce ascetic zeal and such pronounced socialistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
sympathies, that he had done nothing since but
vehemently and bitterly repent his choice.</p>

<p>The Promoter of Companies had been betrayed
into this blunder by the impulse of revengeful
caprice, the only impulse in his otherwise well-balanced
nature that might be termed dangerous to
himself.</p>

<p>He had quarrelled with the bishop over some
matter connected with his stone-works; and in
order to cause this distinguished prelate grief
and annoyance he had looked about for someone
to honour who was under the episcopal ban. The
bishop, however, was of so discreet a temper and
so popular in his diocese that the only rebel to his
authority that could be discovered was one of the
curates of a church at Yeoborough who had insisted
upon preaching the Roman doctrine of Transubstantiation.</p>

<p>The matter would probably have lapsed into
quiescence, save for the crafty interference in the
local newspaper of a group of aggressive Nonconformists,
who took this opportunity of sowing desirable
dissension between the higher and lower orders
of the hated Establishment.</p>

<p>Mr. Romer, who, like Gallio, cared for none of
these things, and was at heart a good deal worse
than a Nonconformist, seized upon the chance
offered by the death of Nevilton’s vicar; and installed
as his successor this rebel to ecclesiastical
authority.</p>

<p>Once installed, however, the Rev. Hugh Clavering
speedily came to an understanding with his bishop;
compromised on the matter of preaching Transubstantiation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and apparently was allowed to go on
believing in it.</p>

<p>And it was then that the Promoter of Companies
learned for the first time how much easier it is to
make a priest than to unmake him. For situation
after situation arose in which the master of the
Leonian quarries found himself confronted by an
alien Power&mdash;a Power that refused to worship
Sandstone. Before this rupture, however, the young
Priest had persuaded Mr. Romer to let him live in
the Old Vicarage, a small but cheerful house just
opposite the church door. The orthodox vicarage,
a rambling Early Victorian structure standing in
its own grounds at the end of the West Drive,
was let&mdash;once more at the Priest’s suggestion&mdash;to
the last living representatives of the dispossessed
Seldoms.</p>

<p>It indicated a good deal of spirit on the part of
Valentia Seldom and her daughter thus to return to
the home of their ancestors.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seldom was a cousin of the man who had
sold the estate. Her daughter Vennie, brought up
in a school at Florence, had never seen Nevilton,
and it was with the idea of taking advantage for the
girl’s sake of their old prestige in that corner of
England that Valentia accepted Mr. Romer’s offer
and became the vicarage tenant.</p>

<p>The quarry-owner himself was influenced in carrying
through this affair, by his anxiety, for the sake
of <em>his</em> daughter, to secure a firmer footing with the
aristocracy of the neighborhood. Here again, however,
he was destined to disappointment: for once
in possession of her twenty years’ lease the old lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
showed not the least intention of letting herself be
used as a social stepping-stone.</p>

<p>She had, indeed, under her own roof, cause enough
for preoccupation and concern.</p>

<p>Her daughter&mdash;a little ghost-moth of a girl, of
fragile delicacy&mdash;seemed entirely devoid of that
mysterious magnetic attraction which lures to the
side of most virgins the devotion of the opposite
sex. She appeared perfectly content to remain forever
in her tender maidenhood, and refused to exert
the slightest effort to be “nice” to the charming
young people her mother threw in her way. She
belonged to that class of young girls who seem to
be set apart by nature for other purposes than those
of the propagation of the race.</p>

<p>Her wistful spirit, shrinking into itself like the
leaves of a sensitive plant at the least approach of
a rough hand, responded only to one passionate
impulse, the impulse of religion.</p>

<p>She grew indeed so estranged from the normal
world, that it was not only Valentia who concealed
the thought that when she left the earth the ancient
race of Seldoms would leave it with her.</p>

<p>Nor was it only in regard to her child’s religious
obsession that the lady suffered. She had flatly
refused to let her enter into anything but the coldest
relations with “those dreadful people at the
House”; and it was with a peculiar shock of dismay
that she found that the girl was not literally obeying
her. It was not, however, to the Romers themselves
that Vennie made her shy overtures, but to a luckless
little relative of that family now domiciled with
them as companion to Gladys Romer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>This young dependent, reputed in the village to
be of Italian origin, struck the gentle heart of the
last of the Seldoms with indescribable pity. She
could not altogether define the impression the girl
produced upon her, but it was a singularly oppressive
one, and it vexed and troubled her.</p>

<p>The situation was wretchedly complicated. It was
extremely difficult to get a word with the little companion
without encountering Gladys; and any approach
to intimacy with “the Romer girl” would
have meant an impossible scene with Mrs. Seldom.
Nor was it a light undertaking, in such hurried
interviews as she did manage to secure, to induce
the child to drop her reserve. She would fix her
great brown foreign eyes&mdash;her name was Lacrima
Traffio&mdash;on Vennie’s face, and make curious little
helpless gestures with her hands when questions
were asked her; but speak of herself she would not.</p>

<p>It was clear she was absolutely dependent on her
cousins. Vennie gathered as much as that, as she
once talked with her under the church wall, when
Gladys was chatting with the vicar. A reference to
her own people had nearly resulted in an outburst
of tears. Vennie had had to be content with a
broken whisper: “We come from Rapallo&mdash;they
are all dead.” There was nothing, it appeared, that
could be added to this.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a little inconsistent in the old lady
to be so resolute against her daughter’s overtures to
Lacrima, as she herself had no hesitation in making
a sort of protégé of another of Mr. Romer’s tribe.</p>

<p>This was an eccentric middle-aged bachelor who
had drifted into the place soon after the new-comer’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
arrival and had established himself in a dilapidated
cottage on the outskirts of the Auber woods.</p>

<p>Remotely related to Mrs. Romer, he had in some
way become dependent on her husband, whose financial
advantage over him was not, it seemed, as time
went on, exerted in a very considerate manner.</p>

<p>Maurice Quincunx, for such was his unusual name,
was an illegitimate descendant of one of the most
historic houses in the neighborhood, but both his
poverty and his opinions caused him to live what
was practically the life of a hermit, and made him
shrink away, even more nervously than little Vennie
Seldom, from any intercourse with his equals.</p>

<p>The present possessors of his queer ancient name
were now the Lords of Glastonbury, and had probably
never so much as heard of Maurice’s existence.</p>

<p>He would come by stealth to pay Valentia visits,
preferring the evening hours when in the summer
she used to sit with her work, on a terrace overlooking
a sloping orchard, and watch Vennie water
her roses.</p>

<p>The vicarage terrace was a place of extraordinary
quiet and peace, eminently adapted to the low-voiced,
nervous ramblings of a recluse of Maurice Quincunx’s
timidity.</p>

<p>The old lady by degrees quite won this eccentric’s
heart; and the queerly assorted friends would pace
up and down for hours in the cool of the evening
talking of things in no way connected either with
Mr. Romer or the Church&mdash;the two subjects about
which Mr. Quincunx held dangerously strong views.</p>

<p>Apart from this quaint outcast and the youthful
parson, Mrs. Seldom’s only other intimate in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
place was a certain John Francis Taxater, a gentleman
of independent means, living by himself with
an old housekeeper in a cottage called The Gables,
situated about half-way between the vicarage and
the village.</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater was a Catholic and also a philosopher;
these two peculiarities affording the solution to what
otherwise would have been an insoluble psychic
riddle. Even as it was, Mr. Taxater’s mind was of
so subtle and complicated an order, that he was at
once the attraction and the despair of all the religious
thinkers of that epoch. For it must be
understood that though quietly resident under the
shadow of Nevilton Mount, the least essay from Mr.
Taxater’s pen was eagerly perused by persons interested
in religious controversy in all the countries of
Europe.</p>

<p>He wrote for philosophical journals in London,
Paris, Rome and New York; and there often appeared
at The Gables most surprising visitors
from Germany and Italy and Spain.</p>

<p>He had a powerful following among the more
subtle-minded of the Catholics of England; and was
highly respected by important personages in the social,
as well as the literary circles, of Catholic society.</p>

<p>The profundity of his mind may be gauged from
the fact that he was able to steer his way successfully
through the perilous reefs of “modernistic”
discussion, without either committing himself to heretical
doctrine or being accused of reactionary ultramontanism.</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater’s written works were, however, but
a trifling portion of his personality. His intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
interests were as rich and varied as those of some
great humanist of the Italian Renaissance, and his
personal habits were as involved and original as his
thoughts were complicated and deep.</p>

<p>He was perpetually engaged in converting the
philosopher in him to Catholicism, and the Catholic
in him to philosophy&mdash;yet he never permitted either
of these obsessions to interfere with his enjoyment
of life.</p>

<p>Luke Andersen, who was perhaps of all the inhabitants
of Nevilton most conscious of the drama
played around him, used to maintain that it was
impossible to tell in the last resort whether Mr.
Taxater’s place was with the adherents of Christ or
with the adherents of Anti-Christ. Like his prototype,
the evasive Erasmus, he seemed able to be on
both sides at the same time.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a secret consciousness of the singular
position of Nevilton, planted, as it were, between
two streams of opposing legend, that originally led
Mr. Taxater to take up his abode in so secluded
a spot.</p>

<p>It is impossible to tell. In this as in all other
transactions of his life he combined an unworldly
simplicity with a Machiavellian astuteness. If the
Day of Judgment revealed him as being on the side
of the angels, it might also reveal him as having
exercised, in the microcosmic Nevilton drama, as
well as in his wider sphere, one of the most subtle
influences against the Powers of Darkness that those
Powers ever encountered in their invisible activity.</p>

<p>At the moment when the present narrative takes
up the woven threads of these various persons’ lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
there seemed every prospect that in external nature
at least there was going to be an auspicious and
halcyon season. June had opened with abnormal
pleasantness. Exquisite odours were in the air,
wafted from woods and fields and gardens. White
dust, alternating with tender spots of coolness where
the shadows of trees fell, lent the roads in the
vicinity that leisured gala-day expectancy which
one notes in the roads of France and Spain, but
which is so rare in England.</p>

<p>It seemed almost as though the damp sub-soil
of the place had relaxed its malign influence; as
though the yellow clay in the churchyard had
ceased its calling for victims; and as though the
brooding monster in the sunset, from which every
day half the men of the village returned with their
spades and picks, had put aside, as irrelevant to a
new and kindlier epoch, its ancient hostility to the
Christian dwellers in that quiet valley.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">OLYMPIAN CONSPIRACY</span></h2>

<p>The depths of Mr. Romer’s mind, as he paced
up and down the Leonian pavement under the
east front of his house on one of the early days
of this propitious June, were seething with predatory
projects. The last of the independent quarries on the
Hill had just fallen into his hands after a legal process
of more than usual chicanery, conducted in person
by the invaluable Mr. Lickwit.</p>

<p>He was now occupied in pushing through Parliament
a bill for the reduction of railway freight
charges, so that the expense of carrying his stone to
its various destinations might be materially reduced.
But it was not only of financial power that he thought
as the smell of the roses from the sun-baked walls
floated in upon him across the garden.</p>

<p>The man’s commercial preoccupations had not by
any means, as so often happens, led to the atrophy
of his more personal instincts.</p>

<p>His erotic appetite, for instance, remained as
insatiable as ever. Age did not dull, nor finance
wither, that primordial craving. The aphrodisiac instincts
in Mortimer Romer were, however, much less
simple than might be supposed.</p>

<p>In this hyper-sensual region he had more claim
to artistic subtlety than his enemies realized. He
rarely allowed himself the direct expansion of frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and downright lasciviousness. His little pleasures
were indirect, elaborate, far-fetched.</p>

<p>He afforded really the interesting spectacle of
one whose mind was normal, energetic, dynamic;
but whose senses were slow, complicated, fastidious.
He was a formidable forward-marching machine, with
a heart of elaborate perversity. He was a thick-skinned
philistine with the sensuality of a sybarite.</p>

<p>I do not mean to imply that there was any lack
of rapacity in the senses of Mr. Romer. His senses
were indeed unfathomable in their devouring depths.
But they were liable to fantastic caprices. They
were not the simple animal senses of a Gothic barbarian.
They assumed imperial contortions.</p>

<p>The main eccentricity of the erotic tendencies of
this remarkable man lay in the elaborate pleasure he
derived from his sense of power. The actual lure of
the flesh had little attraction for him. What pleased
him was a slow tightening of his grip upon people&mdash;upon
their wills, their freedom, their personality.</p>

<p>Any impression a person might make upon Mr.
Romer’s senses was at once transformed into a
desire to have that person absolutely at his mercy.
The thought that he held such a one reduced to
complete spiritual helplessness alone satisfied him.</p>

<p>The first time he had encountered Lacrima Traffio
he had been struck by her appealing eyes, her fragile
figure, her frightened gestures. Deep in his perverted
heart he had desired her; but his desire, under the
psychic law I have endeavoured to explain, quickly
resolved itself into a resolution to take possession
of her, not as his mistress, but as his slave.</p>

<p>Nor did the subtle elaboration of his perversity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
stop there. It were easy and superficial to dominate
in his own person so helpless a dependent. What
was less easy was to reduce her to submission to
the despotic caprices of his daughter, a girl only a
few years older than herself.</p>

<p>The enjoyment of a sense of vicarious power was
a satisfaction curiously provocative to his predatory
craving. Nor did subtlety of the situation stop at
that point. It was not only necessary that the girl
who attracted him should be at his daughter’s
mercy; it was necessary that his daughter should
not be unconscious of the rôle she herself played.
It was necessary that they should be in a sense
confederates in this game of cat-and-mouse.</p>

<p>As Mr. Romer paced the terrace of his imposing
mansion a yet profounder triumph presented itself
in the recesses of his imperial nature.</p>

<p>He had lately introduced into his “entourage” a
certain brother-in-law of his, the widower of his
sister, a man named John Goring. This individual
was of a much simpler, grosser type than the recondite
quarry-owner. He was, indeed, no more than
a narrow-minded, insolent, avaricious animal. He
lacked even the superficial gentility of his formidable
relation. Nor had his concentrated but unintelligent
avarice brought him, so far, any great wealth. He
still remained, in spite of Romer’s help, what he
had been born, an English farmer of unpropitiating
manners and supernal greed.</p>

<p>The Promoter of Companies was, however, not
unaware, any more than was Augustus Cæsar, of
the advantage accruing to a despot from the possession
of devoted, if unattractive, tools; and contemptuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
risking the shock to his social prestige of
such an apparition in the neighborhood, he had
secured Mr. Goring as a permanent tenant of the
largest farm on his estate. This was no other than
the Priory Farm, with its gentle monastic memories.
What the last Prior of Nevilton would have thought
could he have left his grave under St. Catharine’s
altar and reappeared among his dove-cotes it is
distressing to surmise. He would doubtless have
drawn from the sight of John Goring a profoundly
edifying moral as to the results of royal interference
with Christ’s Holy Church. Nor is it likely
that an encounter with Mr. Romer himself would
have caused less astonishment to his mediæval
spirit. He would, indeed, have recognized that what
is now called Progress is no mere scientific phrase;
but a most devastating reality. He would have
found that Nevilton had “progressed” very far. He
would have believed that the queer stone-devils that
his monks had carved, half emerging from the eaves
of the church-roof, had got quite loose and gone
abroad among men. Had he probed, in the manner
of clairvoyant saints, the troubled recesses of Mr.
Romer’s mind as that gentleman inhaled the sweet
noon air, he would have cried aloud his indignation
and made the sign of the cross as if over a mortuary
of spiritual decomposition.</p>

<p>For as the mid-day sun of that hot June morning
culminated, and the clear hard shadows fell, sharp
and thin, upon the orange-tinted pavement, it entered
Mr. Romer’s head that he might make a more
personal use of his farmer-brother than had until
now been possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>With this idea in his brain he entered the house
and sought his wife in her accustomed place at the
corner of the large reception-hall. He sat down
forthright by the side of her mahogany table and
lit a cigar. As Mr. Romer was the species of male
animal that might be written down in the guidebook
of some Martian visitor as “the cigar-smoking
variety” his wife would have taken her place among
“the sedentary knitting ones.”</p>

<p>She was a large, fair, plump, woman, as smooth
and pallid as her husband was grizzled and ruddy.
Her obsequious deference to her lord’s views was only
surpassed by her lethargic animal indolence. She
was like a great, tame, overgrown, white-skinned
Puma. Her eyes had the greenish tint of feline eyes,
and something of their daylight contraction. Her
use of spectacles did not modify this tendency, but
rather increased it; for the effect of the round glass
orbs pushed up upon her forehead was to enhance
the malicious gleam of the little narrow-lidded slits
that peered out beneath them.</p>

<p>It may be imagined with what weary and ironical
detachment the solemn historic portraits of the ancient
Seldoms&mdash;for the pictures and furniture had been
sold with the house&mdash;looked out from their gilded
frames upon these ambiguous intruders. But neither
husband nor wife felt the least touch of “compunctuous
visiting” as they made themselves at ease under
that immense contempt.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” said Mr. Romer, puffing
a thick cloud of defiant smoke into the air, so that
it went sailing up to the very feet of a delicate
Reynolds portrait; “I have been thinking that I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
really quite unjustified in going on with that allowance
to Quincunx. He ought to realize that he has
completely exhausted the money your aunt left him.
He ought to face the situation, instead of quietly
accepting our gift as if it were his right. And they
tell me he does not even keep a civil tongue in his
head. Lickwit was only complaining the other day
about his tampering with our workmen. He has
been going about for some time with those damned
Andersen fellows, and no doubt encouraging them in
their confounded impertinence.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the man, my dear;&mdash;that is the plain
truth. I have never liked him; and he has certainly
never even attempted to conceal his dislike of me.”</p>

<p>“He is very polite to your face, Mortimer,” murmured
the lady.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” Mr. Romer rejoined, “to my face he is
more than polite. He is obsequious; he is cringing.
But behind my back&mdash;damn him!&mdash;the rascal is
a rattlesnake.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, no doubt it has all worked out for
the best”; purred the plump woman, softly counting
the threads of her knitting. “You were in need of
Aunt’s money at the time&mdash;in great need of it.”</p>

<p>“I know I was,” replied the Promoter of Companies,
“I know I was; and he knows I was. That
is why I have been giving him six per cent on what
he lent me. But the fellow has had more than
that. He has had more by this time than the whole
original sum; and I tell you, Susan, it’s got to end;&mdash;it’s
got to end here, now, and forever!”</p>

<p>Mr. Romer’s cigar-smoke had now floated up above
the feet of the Reynolds Portrait and was invading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
its gentle and melancholy face. It was a portrait
of a young girl in the court-dress of the time, but
with such pathetic nun-like features that it was
clear that little Vennie was not the only one of her
race to have grown weary of this rough world.</p>

<p>“It is a providential thing, dear,” whispered the
knitting female, “that there were no horrid documents
drawn up about that money. Maurice cannot
impose upon us in that way.”</p>

<p>“He is doing worse,” answered her husband. “He
is imposing upon us on the strength of a disgusting
sort of sickly sentiment. He has had all his money
back and more; and he knows he has. But he wants
to go on living on my money while he abuses me
on every occasion. Do you know, he even preaches
in that confounded social meeting? I shall have that
affair put a stop to, one of these days. It is only an
excuse for spreading dissatisfaction in the village.
Lickwit has complained to me about it more than
once. He says that Socialistic scoundrel Wone is
simply using the meeting to canvass for his election.
You know he is going to stand, in place of Sir
Herbert Ratcliffe? What the Liberal Party is doing
I cannot conceive&mdash;pandering to these slimy windbags!
And your blessed relation backs him up. The
thing is monstrous, outrageous! Here am I, allowing
this fellow a hundred a year to live in idleness; and
he is plotting against me at my very doorstep.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he does not know that the Conservative
member is going to retire in your favour,” insinuated
the lady.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>“Know? Of course he knows! All the village
knows. All the country knows. You can never hide
things of that kind. He knows, and he is deliberately
working against me.”</p>

<p>“It would be nice if he could get a place as a
clerk,” suggested Mr. Quincunx’s relative, pensively.
“It certainly does not seem fair that you, who work
so hard for the money you make, should support him
in complete idleness.”</p>

<p>Mr. Romer looked at her thoughtfully, knocking
the ashes from his cigar. “I believe you have hit
it there, my dear,” he said. Then he smiled in a
manner peculiarly malignant. “Yes, it would be very
nice if he could get a place as a clerk&mdash;a place
where he would have plenty of simple office work&mdash;a
place where he would be kept to his desk, and not
allowed to roam the country corrupting honest workmen.
Yes, you are quite right, Susan; a clerk’s
place is what this Quincunx wants. And, by Heaven,
what he shall have! I’ll bring the affair to a head
at once. I’ll put it to him that your aunt’s money is
at an end, and that I have already paid him back
in full all that he lent me. I’ll put it to him that
he is now in my debt. In fact, that he is now
entirely dependent on me to the tune of a hundred
a year. And I’ll explain to him that he must either
go out into the world and shift for himself, as better
men than he have had to do, or enter Lickwit’s
office, either in Yeoborough or on the Hill.”</p>

<p>“He will enter the office, Mortimer,” murmured
the lady; “he will enter the office. Maurice is not
the man to emigrate, or do anything of that kind.
Besides he has a reason”&mdash;here her voice became
so extremely mellifluous that it might almost be
said to have liquefied&mdash;“to stay in Nevilton.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s this?” cried Romer, getting up and throwing
his cigar out of the window. “You don’t mean
to tell me&mdash;eh?&mdash;that this scarecrow is in love
with Gladys?”</p>

<p>The lady purred softly and replaced her spectacles.
“Oh dear no! What an idea! Oh certainly, certainly
not! But Gladys, you know, is not the only girl in
Nevilton.”</p>

<p>“Who the devil is it then? Not Vennie Seldom,
surely?”</p>

<p>“Look nearer, Mortimer, look nearer”; murmured
the lady with sibilant sweetness.</p>

<p>“Not Lacrima! You don’t mean to say&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, dear, you needn’t be so surprised. You
look more angry than if it had been Gladys herself.
Yes, of course it is Lacrima. Hadn’t you observed
it? But you dear men are so stupid, aren’t you, in
these things?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romer rubbed one white hand over the
other; and beamed upon her husband through her
spectacles.</p>

<p>Mr. Romer frowned. “But the Traffio girl is so,
so&mdash;you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“So quiet and unimpressionable. Ah! my dear,
it is just these quiet girls who are the very ones to
be enjoying themselves on the sly.”</p>

<p>“How far has this thing gone, Susan?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>“Oh you needn’t get excited, Mortimer. It has not
really ‘gone’ anywhere. It has hardly begun. In
fact I have not the least authority for saying that
she cares for him at all. I think she does a little,
though. I <em>think</em> she does. But one never can tell.
I can, however, give you my word that he cares for
her. And that is what we were talking about, weren’t
we?”</p>

<p>“I shall pack him off to my office in London,”
said Mr. Romer.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t go, my dear. I tell you he wouldn’t
go.”</p>

<p>“But he can’t live on nothing.”</p>

<p>“He can. He will. Sooner than leave Nevilton
Maurice would eat grass. He would become lay-reader
or something. He would sponge on Mrs.
Seldom.”</p>

<p>“Well, then he shall walk to Yeoborough and
back every day. That will cool his blood for him.”</p>

<p>“That will do him a great deal of good, dear; a
great deal of good. Auntie always used to say that
Maurice ought to take more exercise.”</p>

<p>“Lickwit will exercise him! Make no mistake about
that.”</p>

<p>“How you do look round you, dear, in all these
things! How impossible it is for anyone to fool <em>you</em>,
Mortimer!”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Romer uttered these words she glanced
up at the Reynolds portrait above their heads, as
if half-suspecting that such fawning flattery would
bring down the mockery of the little Lady-in-Waiting.</p>

<p>“I can’t help thinking Lacrima would make a very
good wife to some hard-working sensible man,”
Mr. Romer remarked.</p>

<p>His lady looked a little puzzled. “It would be
difficult to find so suitable a companion for Gladys,”
she said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>“Oh, of course I don’t mean till Gladys is married,”
said the quarry-owner quickly. “By the way, when
<em>is</em> she going to accept that young fool of an
Ilminster?”</p>

<p>“All in good time, my dear, all in good time,”
purred his wife. “He has not proposed to her yet.”</p>

<p>“It’s very curious,” remarked Mr. Romer pensively,
“that a young man of such high connections should
<em>wish</em> to marry our daughter.”</p>

<p>“What things you say, Mortimer! Isn’t Gladys
going to inherit all this property? Don’t you suppose
that a younger son of Lord Tintinhull would
jump at the idea of being master of this house?”</p>

<p>“He won’t be master of it while <em>I</em> live,” said Mr.
Romer grimly.</p>

<p>“In my opinion he never will be”; added the lady.
“I don’t think Gladys really intends to accept him.”</p>

<p>“She’ll marry somebody, I hope?” said the master
sharply.</p>

<p>“O yes she’ll marry, soon enough. Only it’ll be a
cleverer man, and a richer man, than young Ilminster.”</p>

<p>“Have you any other pleasant little romance to
fling at me?”</p>

<p>“O no. But I know what our dear Gladys is. I
know what she is looking out for.”</p>

<p>“When she does marry,” said Mr. Romer, “we
shall have to think seriously what is to become of
Lacrima. Look here, my dear,”&mdash;it was wonderful,
the pleasant ejaculatory manner in which this flash
of inspiration was thrown out,&mdash;“why not marry
her to John? She would be just the person for a
farmer’s wife.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romer, to do her justice, showed signs of
being a little shocked at this proposal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“But John,”&mdash;she stammered;&mdash;“John&mdash;is not&mdash;exactly&mdash;a
marrying person, is he?”</p>

<p>“He is&mdash;what I wish him to be”; was her husband’s
haughty answer.</p>

<p>“Oh well, of course, dear, it’s as you think best.
Certainly”&mdash;the good woman could not resist this
little thrust&mdash;“it’s John’s only chance of marrying
a lady. For Lacrima is <em>that</em>&mdash;with all her faults.”</p>

<p>“I shall talk to John about it”; said the Promoter
of Companies. Feline thing though she was, Susan
Romer could not refrain from certain inward qualms
when she thought of the fragile hyper-sensitive Italian
in the embraces of John Goring. What on earth set
her husband dreaming of such a thing? But he was
subject to strange caprices now and then; and it was
more dangerous to balk him in these things than in his
most elaborate financial plots. She had found that
out already. So, on the present occasion, she made
no further remark, than a reiterated&mdash;“How you do
look all round you, Mortimer! It is not easy for
anyone to fool <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>She rose from her seat and collected her knitting.
“I must go and see where Gladys is,” she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Romer followed her to the door, and went out
again upon the terrace. The little nun-like Lady-in-Waiting
looked steadily out across the room, her
pinched attenuated features expressing nothing but
patient weariness of all the ways of this mortal world.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">REPRISALS FROM BELOW</span></h2>

<p>It was approaching the moment consecrated to
the close of the day’s labour in the stone-works
by Nevilton railway-station. The sky was
cloudless; the air windless. It was one of those
magical arrests of the gliding feet of time, which
afternoons in June sometimes bring with them, holding
back, as it were, all living processes of life, in
sweet and lingering suspense. The steel tracks of the
railway-line glittered in the sun. In the fields, that
sloped away beyond them, the browsing cattle wore
that unruffled air of abysmal indifference, which seems
to make one day in their sight to be as a thousand
years. To these placid earth-children, drawing the
centuries together in solemn continuity, the tribes of
men and their turbulent drama were but as vapours
that came and went. The high elms in the hedges
had already assumed that dark monotonous foliage
which gives to their patient stillness on such a day
an atmosphere of monumental expectancy. A flock
of newly-sheared sheep, clean and shining in the hot
sun, drifted in crowded procession down the narrow
road, leaving a cloud of white dust behind them that
remained stationary in the air long after they had
passed. In the open stone-yard close to the road the
brothers Andersen were working together, chipping
and hammering with bare arms at an enormous Leonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
slab, carving its edges into delicate mouldings.
The younger of the two wore no hat, and his closely
clipped fair curls and loose shirt open at the throat,
lent him, as he moved about his work with easy
gestures, a grace and charm well adapted to that
auspicious hour.</p>

<p>A more sombre form by his brother’s side, his broad
brimmed hat low down over his forehead, the elder
Andersen went on with his carving, in imperturbable
morose absorption.</p>

<p>Watching them with languid interest, their arms
linked together, stood the figures of two girls. The
yellow dust from the sandstone rose intermittently
into the air, mingling with the white dust from the
road and settling, as it sank earthward, upon the
leaves of the yet unbudded knapweed and scabious
which grew in the thin dusty grass.</p>

<p>Between Gladys and her cousin&mdash;for the girls had
wandered as far as this in search of distraction after
their lazy tea on the great lawn&mdash;a curious contrast
was now displayed.</p>

<p>Gladys, with slow provocative interest, was intent
on every movement of Luke’s graceful figure. Lacrima’s
attention wandered wistfully away, to the
cattle and the orchards, and then to the sheep, which
now were being penned in a low line of spacious
railway trucks.</p>

<p>Luke himself was by no means unaware of the
condescending interest of his master’s daughter. He
paused in his work once or twice. He turned up his
shirt-sleeves still higher. He bent down, to blow
away the dust from the moulding he had made.
Something very like a flash of amorous admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
passed across his blue eyes as he permitted them slyly
to wander from Gladys’ head to her waist, and from
her waist to her shoes. She certainly was an alluring
figure as she stood there in her thin white dress. The
hand which pulled her skirt away from the dust
showed as soft and warm as if it were pleading for a
caress, and the rounded contours of her bosom looked
as if they had ripened with the early peaches, under
the walls of her stately garden. She presently unlinked
her arm from her companion’s, and sliding it
softly round Lacrima’s side drew the girl close against
her. As she did this she permitted a slow amorous
glance of deliberate tantalization to play upon the
young carver. How well Luke Andersen knew that
especial device of maidens when they are together&mdash;that
way they have of making their playful, innocent
caresses such a teasing incentive! And Luke knew
well how to answer all this. Nothing could have
surpassed in subtle diplomacy the manner in which
he responded, without responding, to the amorous
girl’s overtures. He let her realize that he himself
understood precisely the limits of the situation; that
she was perfectly at liberty to enter a mock-flirtation
with him, without the remotest risk of any “faux
pas” on his part spoiling the delicacy of their relations.</p>

<p>What was indeed obvious to her, without the necessity
of any such unspoken protestation, was the fact
that he found her eminently desirable. Nor did her
pride as “the girl up at the house” quarrel with her
vanity as the simple object of Luke’s admiration.
She wanted him to desire her as a girl;&mdash;to desire
her to madness. And then she wanted to flout him,
with her pretensions as a lady. This particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
occasion was by no means the first time she had
drifted casually down the vicarage hill and lingered
beside the stone-cutters. It was, however, an epoch
in their curious relations. For the first time since
she had been attracted to him, she deliberately moved
close up to the stone he worked at, and entered into
conversation. While this occurred, Lacrima, released
from her rôle as the accomplice of amorous teasing,
wandered away, picking listlessly the first red poppies
of the year, which though less flaunting in
their bold splendour than those of her childhood’s
memories, were at least the same immortal classical
flowers.</p>

<p>As she bent down in this assuaging pastime, letting
her thoughts wander so far from Nevilton and its
tyrants, Lacrima became suddenly conscious that
James Andersen had laid down his tools, resumed his
coat, and was standing by her side.</p>

<p>“A beautiful evening, Miss”; he said respectfully,
holding his hat in his hand and regarding her with
grave gentleness.</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it?” she answered at once; and then
was silent; while a sigh she could not suppress rose
from the depths of her heart. For her thoughts
reverted to another fair evening, in the days when
England was no more than a name; and a sudden
overpowering longing for kind voices, and the shadows
of olives on warm hill-sides, rushed, like a wave, over
her.</p>

<p>“This must be near the Angelus-hour,” she thought;
and somehow the dark grave eyes of the man beside
her and his swarthy complexion made her think
of those familiar forms that used to pass driving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
their goats before them up the rocky paths of the
Apennine range.</p>

<p>“You are unhappy, Miss,” said James in a low
voice; and these words, the only ones of genuine
personal tenderness, except for poor Maurice’s, that
had struck her sense for the last twelve months,
brought tears to her eyes. Vennie Seldom had
spoken kindly to her; but&mdash;God knows&mdash;there is a
difference between the kindness even of the gentlest
saint and this direct spontaneous outflow of one
heart to another. She smiled; a little mournful smile.</p>

<p>“Yes; I was thinking of my own country,” she
murmured.</p>

<p>“You are an Italian, Miss; I know it”; continued
Andersen, instinctively leading her further away from
the two golden heads that now were bending so close
together over the Leonian stone.</p>

<p>“I often think of Italy,” he went on; “I think I
should be at home in Italy. I love everything I hear
of it, everything I read of it. It comes from my
mother, this feeling. She was a lady, you know Miss,
as well born as any and with a passionate love of
books. She used to read Dante in that little ‘Temple’
Series, which perhaps you have seen, with the
Italian on one side and the English on the other. I
never look at that book without thinking of her.”</p>

<p>“You have many books yourself, I expect,&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Andersen.
You see I know your name.” And
Lacrima smiled, the first perfectly happy smile she
had been betrayed into for many months.</p>

<p>“It is not a very nice name,” said James, a little
plaintively. “I wish I had a name like yours Miss&mdash;Traffio.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, I think yours is quite as nice,” she answered
gravely. “It makes me think of the man who wrote
the fairy stories.”</p>

<p>James Andersen frowned, “I don’t like fairy
stories,” he said almost gruffly. “They tease and fret
me. I like Thomas Hardy’s books. Do you know
Thomas Hardy?” Lacrima made a little involuntary
gesture of depreciation. As a matter of fact her
reading, until very lately, had been as conventual as
that of a young nun. Vennie Seldom or the demure
Reynolds girl could not have been more innocent of
the darker side of literature. Hardy’s books she had
seen in the hands of Gladys, and the association
repelled her. Pathetically anxious to brush away this
little cloud, she began hurriedly talking to her new
friend of Italy; of its cities, its sea-coasts, its monasteries,
its churches. James Andersen listened with
reverential attention, every now and then asking a
question which showed how deeply his mother’s love
of the classical country had sunk into his nature.</p>

<p>By this time they had wandered along the road as
far as a little stone bridge with low parapets which
crosses there a muddy Somersetshire stream. From
this point the road rises quite steeply to the beginning
of the vicarage garden. Leaning against the parapet
of the little bridge, and looking back, they saw to
their surprise that Gladys and Luke had not only not
followed them but had completely disappeared.</p>

<p>The last of the unskilled workmen from the sheds,
trailing up the road together laughing and chatting,
turned when they passed, and gazed back, as our
two companions were doing, at the work-shops
they had left, acknowledging Lacrima’s gentle “good-night”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
with a rather shifty salutation.&mdash;This girl
was after all only a dependent like themselves.&mdash;They
had hardly gone many steps before they burst
into a loud rough guffaw of rustic impertinence.</p>

<p>Lacrima struck the ground nervously with her
parasol. “What has happened?” she asked; “where
has Gladys gone?”</p>

<p>James Andersen shrugged his shoulders, “I expect
they have wandered into the shed,” he rejoined, “to
look at my brother’s work there.”</p>

<p>She glanced nervously up and down the road;
gave a quaint little sigh and made an expressive
gesture with her hands as if disclaiming all responsibility
for her cousin’s doings. Then, quite suddenly,
she smiled at Andersen with a delicious childish smile
that transfigured her face.</p>

<p>“Well, I am glad I am not left alone at any rate,”
she said.</p>

<p>“I have a presentiment,” the stone-cutter answered,
“that this is not the last time you will be
thrown upon my poor company.”</p>

<p>The girl blushed, and smiled confidingly. Her
manner was the manner of a child, who has at last
found a safe protector. Then all of a sudden she
became very grave. “I hope,” she said, “that you
are one of the people who are kind to Mr. Quincunx.
He is a <em>great</em> friend of mine.”</p>

<p>Never had the melancholy intimation, that one
could not hope to hold anything but the second place
in a woman’s heart, been more tenderly or more
directly conveyed!</p>

<p>James Andersen bowed his head.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p>“Mr. Quincunx has always been very kind to <em>me</em>,”
he said, “and certainly, after what you say, I shall
do all in my power to help him. But I can do very
little. I believe Mrs. Seldom understands him better
than anyone else.”</p>

<p>He had hardly finished speaking when the figures
of two men made themselves visible opposite the
back entrance of the vicarage. They were leisurely
strolling down the road, and every now and then they
would pause, as if the interest of their conversation
was more than the interest of the way.</p>

<p>“Why! There <em>is</em> Mr. Quincunx,” cried the Italian;
and she made an instinctive movement as if to put a
little further space between herself and her companion.
“Who is that person with him?” she added.</p>

<p>“It looks like George Wone,” answered the stone-cutter.
“Yes, it is George; and he is talking as
usual at the top of his voice. You’d suppose he
wanted to be heard by all Nevilton.”</p>

<p>Lacrima hesitated and looked very embarrassed.
She evidently did not know whether to advance in
the direction of the new-comers or to remain where
she was. Andersen came to her rescue.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said he, “it would be better if I went
back and told Miss Romer you are waiting for her.”
Lacrima gave him a quick glance of responsive
gratitude.</p>

<p>“O, that would be really kind of you, Mr. Andersen,”
she said.</p>

<p>The moment he had gone, however, she felt annoyed
that she had let him go. It looked so odd, she
thought, his leaving her so suddenly, directly Maurice
came on the scene. Besides, what would Gladys say
at this interruption of her pleasure? She would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
suppose she had done it out of pure spitefulness!
The moments seemed very long to her as she waited
at the little bridge, tracing indecipherable hieroglyphics
in the dust with the end of her parasol.
She kept her eyes steadily fixed on the tall retreating
figure of the stone-cutter as he slouched with his long
shambling stride towards the work-shop. The two
men were not, however, really long in approaching.
Maurice had seen her from the beginning, and his
replies to Mr. Wone’s oratory had grown proportionally
brief.</p>

<p>When they reached her, the girl shook hands with
Maurice and bowed rather coldly to Mr. Wone.
That gentleman was not however in the least quelled
or suppressed. It was one of his most marked
characteristics to have absolutely no consciousness of
season or situation. When less clever people would
have wished the earth to swallow them up, Mr. Wone
remained imperviously self-satisfied. Having exchanged
greetings, Lacrima hastened to explain that
she was waiting at this spot till Miss Romer should
rejoin her. “Luke Andersen is showing her his
work,” she said, “and James has gone to tell her I am
waiting.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wone became voluble at this. “It is a shame
to keep a young lady like yourself waiting in the
middle of the road.” He turned to Mr. Quincunx.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
“We must not say all we think, must we? But
begging this young lady’s pardon, it is just like the
family. No consideration! No consideration for
anyone! It is the same with his treatment of the
poor. I am talking of Mr. Romer, you know, Miss.
I would say the same thing to his face. Why is it
that hard-working clever fellows, like these Andersens
for instance, should do all the labour, and he get all
the profits? It isn’t fair. It’s unjust. It’s an insult
to God’s beautiful earth, which is free to all.” He
paused to take breath, and looked to Maurice for
confirmation of his words.</p>

<p>“You are quite right, Wone; you are quite right,”
muttered the recluse in his beard, furtively glancing
at Lacrima.</p>

<p>Mr. Wone continued his discourse, making large
and eloquent allusion to the general relations in
England between employer and employed, and implying
plainly enough his full knowledge that at least
one of his hearers belonged to the latter class. His
air, as he spoke, betrayed a certain disordered fanaticism,
quite genuine and deeply felt, but queerly
mingled with an indescribable element of complacent
self-conceit. Lacrima, in spite of considerable sympathy
with much that he said, felt that there was, in
the man himself, something so slipshod, so limp, so
vague, and so patently vulgar, that both her respect
for his sincerity and her interest in his opinions were
reduced to nothing. Not only was he narrow-minded
and ignorant; but there was also about him, in spite
of the aggressive violence of his expressions, an odd
sort of deprecatory, apologetic air, as though he were
perpetually endeavouring to cajole his audience, by
tacit references to his deferential respect for them.
There was indeed more than a little in him of the sleek
unction of the nonconformist preacher; and one could
well understand how he might combine, precisely as
Mr. Lickwit suspected, the divergent functions of the
politician and the evangelist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I tell you,” he was saying, “the country will not
long put up with this sort of thing. There is a movement,
a tendency, a volcanic upheaval, a stirring of
waters, which these plutocrats do not realize. There
is a surging up from the depths of&mdash;of&mdash;” He
paused for a word.</p>

<p>“Of mud,” murmured Mr. Quincunx.</p>

<p>“&mdash;Of righteous revolt against these atrocious inequalities!
The working people are asleep no longer.
They’re roused. The movement’s begun. The thunder’s
gathering on the horizon. The armies of the
exploited are feeling the impulse of their own strength,
of that noble, that splendid anger, which, when it is
conceived, will bring forth&mdash;will bring forth&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Damnation,” murmured Mr. Quincunx.</p>

<p>The three figures as they stood, thus consorted,
on the little stone bridge, made up a dramatic group.
The sinking sun threw their shadows in long wavering
lines upon the white road, distorting them to so
grotesque a length that they nearly reached the open
gates of the station.</p>

<p>Human shadows! What a queer half-mocking commentary
they make upon the vanity of our passionate
excitements, roused by anything, quieted by
nothing, as the world moves round!</p>

<p>Lacrima, in her shadow, was not beautiful at all.
She was an elongated wisp of darkness. The beard
of Mr. Quincunx looked as if it belonged to a mammoth
goat, and the neck of Mr. Wone seemed to
support, not a human cranium at all, but a round,
wagging mushroom.</p>

<p>The hushed fields on each side of the way began to
assume that magical softness which renders them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
at such an hour, insubstantial, unreal, remote, transformed.
One felt as though the earth might indeed
be worthy of better destinies than those that traced
their fantastic trails up and down its peaceful surface.
Something deeply withheld, seemed as though it only
needed the coming of one god-like spirit to set it free
forever, and, with it, all the troubled hearts of men.
It was one of those moments which, whether the participants
in them recognize them or not, at the actual
time, are bound to recur, long afterwards, to their
memory.</p>

<p>Lacrima, half-listening to Mr. Wone, kept her head
anxiously turned in the direction of the sheds, into
one of which she had observed James Andersen enter.</p>

<p>Maurice Quincunx, his mood clogged and clotted
by jealousy, watched her with great melancholy grey
eyes, while with his nervous fingers he plucked at his
beard.</p>

<p>“The time is coming&mdash;the time is coming”; cried
Mr. Wone, striking with the back of his fist, the
parapet against which he leaned, “when this exploitation
of the poor by the rich will end once for all!”
The warmth of his feeling was so great, that large
drops of sweat trickled down his sallow cheeks, and
hanging for a moment at the end of his narrow chin,
fell into the dust. The man was genuinely moved;
though in his watery blue eyes no trace of any fire
was visible. He looked, in his emotion, like an
hypnotized sick person, talking in the stress of a
morbid fever. It was the revolt of one who carried
the obsequious slavery of generations in his blood,
and could only rebel in galvanized moribund spasms.
The fellow was unpleasing, uninspiring: not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
savage leader of a race of stern revolutionary devotees
fired by the iron logic of their cause, but the inchoate
inarticulate voice of clumsy protest, apologizing and
propitiating, even while it protested. The vulgarity
and meanness of the candidate’s tone made one
wonder how such a one as he could ever have been
selected by the obscure working of the Spirit of Sacrifice,
to undertake this titanic struggle against the
Spirit of Power. One turned away instinctively from
his febrile rhetoric, to cast involuntary incense at the
feet of the masterful enemy he opposed. He had no
reticence in his enthusiasm, no reserve, no decency.</p>

<p>“You may perhaps not know,” he blundered on;
“that the General Election is much nearer than people
think. Mr. Romer will find this out; he will find it
out; he will find it out! I have good authority
for what I say. I speak of what I know, young
lady.” This was said rather severely, for Lacrima’s
attention was so obviously wandering.&mdash;“Of course
you will not breathe a word of this, up there,”&mdash;he
nodded in the direction of the House. “It
would not do. But the truth is, he is making a great
mistake. I am prepared for this campaign, and he
is not. He is even thinking of reducing the men’s
wages still further. The fool&mdash;the fool&mdash;the fool!
For he <em>is</em> a fool, you know, though he thinks he is so
clever.”</p>

<p>Even Mr. Wone would scarcely have dared to
utter these bold asseverations in the ear of Gladys
Romer’s cousin, if Maurice’s innate indiscretion had
not made it the gossip of the village that the Italian
was ill-treated “among those people.” To the
pathetic man’s poor vulgar turn of mind there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
something soothing in this confidential abuse of the
lord of Nevilton Manor to his own relation. It had
a squalid piquancy. It was itself a sort of revenge.</p>

<p>Once more he began his spasmodic enunciation of
those sad economic platitudes that are the refuge of
the oppressed; but Mr. Quincunx had crossed the
road, in the pursuit of a decrepit tiger-moth, and was
listening no more. Lacrima’s attention was completely
withdrawn.</p>

<p>“Well, dear friends,” he concluded, “I must really
be getting back to my supper. Mrs. Wone will be
unbearable if I am late.” He hesitated a moment
as if wondering whether the occasion called for any
further domestic jocosity, to let these high matters
lightly down to earth; but he contented himself with
shaking hands with Mr. Quincunx and removing his
hat to Lacrima.</p>

<p>“Good night, dear friends,” he repeated, drifting
off, up the road, humming a hymn tune.</p>

<p>“Poor man!” whispered the girl, “he means well.”</p>

<p>“He ought to be shot!” was the unexpected response
of the hermit of Dead Man’s Cottage, as he
let the tiger-moth flutter down into the edge of the
field. “He is no better than the rest. He is an
idiot. He ought to learn Latin.”</p>

<p>They moved together towards the station.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the way you agree with people to
their face,” said Lacrima, “and abuse them behind
their backs.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the way you hang about the roads
with handsome stone-cutters,” was Mr. Quincunx’s
surly retort.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a quite interesting little drama had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
been unfolding itself in the neighbourhood of the
half-carved block of sandstone. Instructed, by a
swift flash of perception, into what the situation
implied, Luke’s quick magnetic fingers soon drew
from his companion’s an electric responsive clasp, as
they leant together over the mouldings. The warmth
and pliable softness of the girl’s body seemed to
challenge the man with intimations of how quickly it
would yield. He pointed to the shed-door, wide open
behind them.</p>

<p>“I will show you my work, in there, in a moment,”
he murmured, “as soon as they have gone.”</p>

<p>Her breast rose and fell under the increased excitement
of her breathing. Violent quivers ran up and
down her frame and communicated themselves to
him. Their hearts beat fiercely in reciprocal agitation.
Luke’s voice, as he continued his conventional
summary of the quality and destination of the stone,
shook a little, and sounded queer and detached.</p>

<p>“It is for Shaftesbury church,” he said, “for the
base of the column that supports the arch. This
particular moulding is one which my father designed.
You must remember that upon it will rest a great
deal of the weight of the roof.”</p>

<p>His fellow workmen had now collected their tools
and were shuffling nervously past them. It required
all Gladys’ sang-froid to give them the casual nod due
from the daughter of the House to those who laboured
in its service. As soon as they were well upon their
way, with a quick glance at the distant figures of
Lacrima and James, Gladys turned rapidly to her
companion.</p>

<p>“Show me,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>He went before her and stood in the entrance of
the work-shop. When she had passed him into its
interior, he casually closed behind them one of the
rough folding doors. The contrast from the horizontal
sun outside, turning the sandstone blocks into
ruddy gold, to the shadowy twilight within, was
strangely emphatic. He began to speak; saying he
hardly knew what&mdash;some kind of stammered nonsense
about the bases and capitals and carved mouldings
that lay around them. But Gladys, true to her
feminine prerogative, swept all this aside. With a
bold audacity she began at once.</p>

<p>“How nice to be alone and free, for a little while!”</p>

<p>Then, moving still further into the shadow, and
standing, as if absorbed in interest, before the rough
beginnings of a fluted pillar which reached as high as
the roof&mdash;</p>

<p>“What kind of top are you going to put on to that
thing?”</p>

<p>As she spoke she leant against the pillar with a
soft, weary relaxation of her whole form.</p>

<p>“Come near and tell me about it,” she whispered,
as if her breath caught in her throat.</p>

<p>Luke recognized the tone&mdash;the tone that said, so
much more distinctly than words, “I am ready.
Why are you so slow?” He came behind her, and as
gently and lightly as he could, though his arms
trembled, let his fingers slide caressingly round her
flexible figure. Her breath came in quick gasps, and
one hot small hand met his own and pressed it against
her side. Encouraged by this response, he boldly
drew her towards him. She struggled a little; a shy
girlish struggle, more than half conventional&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
then, sliding round in his arms with a quick feline
movement, she abandoned herself to her craving, and
embraced him shamelessly and passionately. When
at last in sheer weariness her arms relaxed and she
sank down, with her hands pressed to her burning
cheeks, upon an unfinished font, Luke Andersen
thought that never to his dying day would he forget
the serpentine clinging of that supple form and the
pressure of those insatiable lips. He turned, a little
foolishly, towards the door and kicked with his foot a
fragment of a carved reredos. Then he went back to
her and half-playfully, half-amorously, tried to remove
her hands from her face.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch me! I hate you!” she said.</p>

<p>“Please,” he whispered, “please don’t be unkind now.
I shall never, never forget how sweet you’ve been.”</p>

<p>“Tell me more about this work of yours,” she
suddenly remarked, in a completely changed voice,
rising to her feet. “I have always understood that
you were one of our best workmen. I shall tell my
father how highly I think of what you’re doing&mdash;you
and your brother. I am sure he will be glad to
know what artists he has among his men.”</p>

<p>She gave her head a proud little toss and raised
negligent deliberate hands to her disarranged fair
hair, smoothing it down and readjusting her wide-brimmed
hat. She had become the grand lady again
and Luke had become the ordinary young stone-mason.
Superficially, and with a charming grace, he
adapted himself to this change, continuing his conventional
remarks about fonts, pillars, crosses, and
capitals; and calling her “Miss” or “Miss Gladys,”
with scrupulous discretion. But in his heart, all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
while, he was registering a deep and vindictive vow&mdash;a
vow that, at whatever risk and at whatever cost,
he would make this fair young despot suffer for her
caprice. Gladys had indeed, quite unwittingly,
entered into a struggle with a nature as remorseless
and unscrupulous as her own. She had dreamed, in
her imperial way, of using this boy for her amusement,
and then throwing him aside. She did not for
a moment intend to get entangled in any sentimental
relations with him. A passing “amour,” leading to
nothing, and in no way committing her, was what she
had instinctively counted on. For the rest, in snatching
fiercely at any pleasure her fervent senses craved,
she was as conscienceless and antinomian, as a young
tiger out of the jungle. Nor had she the remotest
sense of danger in this exciting sport. Corrupt and
insensitive as any amorous courtezan of a pagan age,
she trusted to her freedom from innocence to assure
her of freedom from disaster. Vaguely enough in
her own mind she had assumed, as these masterful
“blond beasts” are inclined to assume, that in
pouncing on this new prey she was only dealing once
more with that malleable and timorous humanity she
had found so easy to mould to her purpose in other
quarters. She reckoned, with a pathetic simplicity,
that Luke would be clay in her hands. As a matter
of fact this spoiled child of the wealth produced by
the Leonian stone had audaciously flung down her
challenge to one who had as much in him as herself
of that stone’s tenacity and imperviousness. The
daughter of sandstone met the carver of sandstone;
and none, who knew the two, would have dared to
predict the issue of such an encounter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The young man was still urbanely and discreetly
discoursing to his lady-visitor upon the contents of
the work-shop, when the tall figure of James Andersen
darkened the door.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Miss,” he said to Gladys, “but Miss
Lacrima asked me to tell you that she was waiting
for you on the bridge.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, James,” answered the girl simply,
“I will come. I am afraid my interest in all the
things your brother has been so kindly showing me
has made you both late. I am sorry.” Here she
actually went so far as to fumble in her skirt for her
purse. After an awkward pause, during which the
two men waited at either side of the door, she
found what she sought, and tripping lightly by,
turned as she passed Luke and placed in his hand,
the hand that so recently had been clasped about her
person, the insolent recompense of a piece of silver.
Bidding them both good-night, she hurried away
to rejoin Lacrima, who, having by this time got rid
of Mr. Quincunx, moved down the road to meet
her.</p>

<p>Luke closed and locked the door of the shed without
a word. Then to the astonishment of James Andersen
he proceeded to dance a kind of grotesque war-dance,
ending it with a suppressed half-mocking
howl, as he leant exhausted against the wall of the
building.</p>

<p>“I’ve got her, I’ve got her, I’ve got her!” he
repeated. “James, my darling Daddy James, I’ve got
this girl in the palm of my hand!” He humorously
proceeded to toss the coin she had given him high in
the air. “Heads or tails?” he cried, as the thing fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
among the weeds. “Heads! It’s heads, my boy!
That means that Miss Gladys Romer will be sorry
she ever stepped inside this work-shop of ours. Come,
let’s wash and eat, my brother; for the gods have
been good to us today.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">FRANCIS TAXATER</span></h2>

<p>The day following the one whose persuasive
influence we have just recorded was not
less auspicious. The weather seemed to have
effected a transference of its accustomed quality,
bringing to the banks of the Yeo and the Parret the
atmospheric conditions belonging to those of the
Loire or the Arno.</p>

<p>Having finished her tea Valentia Seldom was strolling
meditatively up and down the vicarage terrace,
alternately stopping to pick off the petals of a dead
flower, or to gaze, with a little gloomy frown, upon
the grass of the orchard.</p>

<p>Her slender upright figure, in her black silk dress,
made a fine contrast to the rich green foliage about
her, set on one side with ruby-coloured roses and on
the other with yellow buttercups. But the old lady
was in no peaceful frame of mind. Every now and
then she tapped the gravel impatiently with her
ebony stick; and the hand that toyed with the
trinkets at her side mechanically closed and unclosed
its fingers under the wrist-band of Mechlin lace. It
was with something of an irritable start, that she
turned round to greet Francis Taxater, as led by the
little servant he presented himself to her attention.
He moved to greet her with his usual imperturbable
gravity, walking sedately along the edge of the flowery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
border; with one shoulder a little higher than the
other and his eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>His formidable prelatical chin seemed more than
ever firmly set that afternoon, and his grey waistcoat,
under his shabby black coat, was tightly drawn
across his emphatic stomach. His coal-black eyes,
darkened yet further by the shadow of his hat,
glanced furtively to right and left of him as he advanced.
In the manner peculiar to persons disciplined
by Catholic self-control, his head never followed, by
the least movement, the shrewd explorations of these
diplomatic eyes.</p>

<p>One would have taken him for a French bishop, of
aristocratic race, masquerading, for purposes of discretion,
in the dress of a secular scholar.</p>

<p>Everything about Francis Taxater, from the noble
intellectual contours of his forehead, down to his
small satyr-like feet, smacked of the courtier and the
priest; of the learned student, and the urbane frequenter
of sacred conclaves. His small white hand,
plump and exquisitely shaped, rested heavily on his
cane. He carried with him in every movement and
gesture that curious air of dramatic weight and importance
which men of diplomatic experience are
alone able to use without letting it degenerate into
mannerism. It was obvious that he, at any rate,
according to Mr. Quincunx’s favourite discrimination,
“knew Latin.” He seemed to have slid, as it were,
into this commercial modern world, from among the
contemporaries of Bossuet. One felt that his authors
were not Ibsen or Tolstoy, but Horace and Cicero.</p>

<p>One felt also, however, that in sheer psychological
astuteness not even Mr. Romer himself would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
match for him. Between those two, the man of
modern wisdom and the man of ancient wisdom, any
struggle that might chance to occur would be a singularly
curious one. If Mr. Taxater really was “on the
side of the angels,” he was certainly there with the
full weight of organized hierarchies. If he did exert
his strength upon the side of “meekness,” it would
be a strength of no feverish, spasmodic eruption.</p>

<p>If Satan threw a Borgia in Mr. Taxater’s path,
that Borgia, it appeared, would find his Machiavel.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a lovely day again,” said the old lady,
leading her visitor to a seat and placing herself by his
side. “But what is our naughty Monsignor doing,
playing truant from his consistory? I thought you
would be in London this week&mdash;at the Eucharist
Conference your people are holding? Is it to the
loveliness of the weather that we owe this pleasant
surprise?”</p>

<p>One almost expected&mdash;so formal and old-fashioned
were the two interlocutors&mdash;that Mr. Taxater would
have replied, in the tone of Ivanhoe or the Talisman,
“A truce to such jesting, Madam!” No doubt if he
had, the lady would hardly have discerned any
anachronism. As a matter of fact he did not answer
her question at all, but substituted one of his own.</p>

<p>“I met Vennie in the village,” he said. “Do you
think she is happier now, in her new English circle?”</p>

<p>“Ah! my friend,” cried the old lady, in a nervous
voice, “it is of Vennie that I have been thinking all
this afternoon. No, I cannot say I think she is happier.
I wonder if it is one thing; and then I wonder
if it is another. I cannot get to the bottom of it and
it worries me.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“I expect it is her nerves,” said the diplomatist.
“Though the sun is so warm, there has been a constant
east wind lately; and, as you know, I put down
most of our agitations to the presence of east wind.”</p>

<p>“It will not do, Mr. Taxater; it will not do! It
may be the east wind with you and me. It is not
the east wind with Vennie. Something is troubling
her. I wish I could discern what it is?”</p>

<p>“She isn’t by any chance being vexed by some
theological dispute with the Vicar, is she? I know
how seriously she takes all his views. And his views
are, if I may say so, decidedly confusing. Don’t
misunderstand me, dear lady. I respect Mr. Clavering
and admire him. I like the shape of his head; especially
when he wears his beretta. But I cannot
feel much confidence in his wisdom in dealing with a
sensitive child like your daughter. He is too impulsive.
He is too dogmatic. He lives too entirely
in the world of doctrinal controversy. It is dangerous”;
here Mr. Taxater luxuriously stretched out his
legs and lit a cigarette; “it is dangerous to live only
for theology. We have to learn to live for Religion;
and that is a much more elaborate affair. <em>That</em>
extends very far, Mrs. Seldom.” The old lady let
her stick slide to the ground and clasped her hands
together. “I want to ask you one thing, Mr. Taxater.
And I implore you to be quite direct with me. You
do not think, do you, that my girl is tending towards
<em>your</em> church&mdash;towards Rome? I confess it would
be a heavy blow to me, one of the heaviest I have
ever had, if anything of that kind happened. I know
you are tolerant enough to let me speak like this
without scruple. I like <em>you</em>, my dear friend&mdash;”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Here a soft flush spread over Valentia’s ivory-coloured
cheeks and she made a little movement as if to put
her hand on her companion’s arm. “I like you
yourself, and have the utmost confidence in you. But
Oh, it would be a terrible shock to me if Vennie became
a Roman Catholic. She would enter a convent; I
<em>know</em> she would enter a convent and that would be
more than I could bear.” The accumulated distress
of many years was in the old lady’s voice and tears
stood in her eyes. “I know it is silly,” she went on
as Mr. Taxater steadily regarded the landscape.
“But I cannot help it. I do so hope&mdash;Oh, I can’t tell
you how much&mdash;that Vennie will marry and have
children. It is the secret burden of my life, the
thought that, with this frail little thing, our ancient
race should disappear. I feel it my deepest duty&mdash;my
duty to the Past and my duty to the Future&mdash;to
arrange a happy marriage for her. If only that
could be achieved, I should be able to die content.”</p>

<p>“You have no evidence, no authority for thinking,”
said Mr. Taxater gravely, “that she is meditating
any approach to <em>my</em> church, as you call it, have you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” cried the old lady, “quite the contrary.
She seems absorbed in the services here. She works
with Mr. Clavering, she discusses everything with
Mr. Clavering, she helps Mr. Clavering with the poor.
I believe”&mdash;here Valentia lowered her voice; “I
believe she confesses to Mr. Clavering.”</p>

<p>Francis Taxater smiled&mdash;the smile of the heir of
Christendom’s classic faith at these pathetic fumblings
of heresy&mdash;and carefully knocked the ashes from his
cigarette against the handle of his cane.</p>

<p>“You don’t think, dear lady,” he said, “that by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
any chance&mdash;girls are curiously subtle in these little
things&mdash;she is ‘in love,’ as they call it, with our
nice handsome Vicar?”</p>

<p>Valentia gave an involuntary little start. In her
heart there rose up the shadow of a shadow of questioning,
whether in this last remark the great secular
diplomatist had not lapsed into something approaching
a “faux pas.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” she answered. “Vennie is not a
girl to mix up her religion with things of that sort.”</p>

<p>Francis Taxater permitted the flicker of a smile to
cross his face. He slightly protruded his lower lip
which gave his countenance a rather sinister expression.
His look said, more clearly than words, that in
his opinion there was no woman on earth who did
not “mix up these things” with her religion.</p>

<p>“I have not yet made my request to you,” continued
the old lady, with a certain nervous hesitation.
“I am so afraid lest you should think it an evidence
of a lack of confidence. It isn’t so! It really isn’t
so. I only do it to relieve my mind;&mdash;to make my
food taste better, if you understand?&mdash;and to stop
this throbbing in my head.” She paused for a moment,
and picking up her stick, prodded the gravel
with it, with lowered face. The voices of not less
than three wood-pigeons were audible from the
apple-orchard. And this soft accompaniment to her
words seemed to give her courage. Fate could not,
surely, altogether betray her prayers, in a place so
brooded over by “the wings of the dove.” In the
exquisite hush of the afternoon the birds’ rich voices
seemed to take an almost liturgical tone&mdash;as though
they were the ministers of a great natural temple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
To make a solemn request of a dear friend under such
conditions was almost as though one were exacting
a sacred vow under the very shadow of the altar.</p>

<p>So at least Valentia felt, as she uttered her serious
petition; though it may well be that Mr. Taxater,
skilled in the mental discipline of Saint Ignatius, knew
better how to keep the distracting influences of mere
“Nature,” in their proper secondary place.</p>

<p>“I want you faithfully to promise me,” she said,
“that you will in no way&mdash;in no way at all&mdash;use
your influence over Vennie to draw her from her
English faith.” The old lady’s voice became quite
husky in her emotion. “It would be dreadful to me
to think,&mdash;I could not bear to think”&mdash;she went
on, “that you should in the smallest degree use your
great powers of mind to disturb the child’s present
attitude. If she is not happy, it is not&mdash;Oh, I assure
you, it is not&mdash;in any sense due to her being dissatisfied
with her religion. It must be something
quite different. What it is, I cannot guess; but it
must be something quite different from <em>that</em>. Well,
dear friend,” and she did now, quite definitely, lay
her hand on his arm, “will you promise this for me?
You will? I know you will.”</p>

<p>Francis Taxater rose from his seat and stood over
her very gravely, leaning upon his cane.</p>

<p>“You have done well to tell me this, Mrs. Seldom,”
he said. “Most certainly I shall make no attempt to
influence Vennie. It would be indeed contrary to all
that I regard as wise and suitable in the relations
between us. I never convert people. I believe you
will find that very few of those who are born Catholics
ever interfere in that way. It is the impetuosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of new-comers into the church that gives us this
bad name. They often carry into their new faith
the turbulent theological zeal which distinguished
them in their old one. I, at any rate, am not like
that. I leave people alone. I prefer to watch them
develop on their own lines. The last thing I should
wish to do would be to meddle with Vennie’s religious
taste. It would be a blunder as well as an impertinence.
Vennie would be the first to resist any such
proceeding. It would destroy her respect for me. It
might even destroy her affection for me. It certainly
would not move her. Indeed, dear lady, if I wished
to plant the child’s soul irrevocably in the soil prepared
by our good vicar I could not do anything
more effective than try to persuade her of its deficiencies.
No, no! You may rely upon me to stand
completely aside in this matter. If Vennie <em>were</em> led
to join us&mdash;which for your sake, dear Mrs. Seldom,
I hope will never happen,&mdash;you may accept
my word of honour it will be from her own spontaneous
impulse. I shall make not the least movement
in the direction you fear. <em>That</em> I can devoutly
promise.”</p>

<p>He turned away his head and regarded with calm,
placid detachment the rich, shadowy orchard and
the golden buttercups.</p>

<p>The contours of his profile were so noble, and the
pose of his head so majestic, that the agitated mother
was soothed and awed into complete confidence.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” she exclaimed. “<em>That</em> fear, at any
rate, has passed. I shall be grateful to you forever,
dear friend, for what you have just now said. It is
a direct answer to my prayers.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“May I, in my turn,” said Mr. Taxater, resuming
his seat by her side, “ask you a bold and uncalled
for question? What would you do, if in the changes
and chances of this life, Vennie <em>did</em> come to regard
Mr. Clavering with favour? Would you for a moment
consider their union as a possible one?”</p>

<p>Valentia looked not a little embarrassed. Once
more, in her heart, she accused the urbane scholar
of a lack of delicacy and discretion. These little
questions are not the ones to put to a perturbed
mother.</p>

<p>However, she answered him plainly enough. “I
should not like it, I confess. It would disappoint
me. I am not ambitious, but sometimes I catch
myself desiring, for my beloved child, a marriage that
would give her the position she deserves, the position&mdash;pardon
a woman’s weakness, sir!&mdash;that her ancestors
held in this place. But then, again, I am
only anxious for her happiness. No, Mr. Taxater.
If such a thing did occur I should not oppose it,
Mr. Clavering is a gentleman, though a poor one and,
in a sense, an eccentric one. But I have no prejudice
against the marriage of our clergy. In fact I
think they ought to marry. It is so suitable, you
know, to have a sensible woman endowed with such
opportunities for making her influence felt. I would
not wish Vennie to marry beneath her, but sooner
than not see her married&mdash;well!&mdash;That is the
kind of feeling I have about it, Mr. Taxater.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>“Thank you&mdash;thank you. I fear my question
was impertinent; but in return for the solemn oath
you exacted from me, I think I deserved some reward,
don’t you? But seriously, Mrs. Seldom, I
do not think that any of these less desirable fates
will befall our dear child. I think she will marry a
pillar of the aristocracy, and remain herself a pillar
of the Anglican Church! I trust she will not, whatever
happens, lose her regard for her old Catholic
friend.”</p>

<p>He rose as he spoke and held out his hand. Mrs.
Seldom took it in her own and held it for a moment
with some emotion. Had he been a real Monsignor,
he could not have looked more calm, more tolerant,
more kind, than he looked at that moment. He
wore the expression that high ecclesiastics must come
to wear, when devoted but somewhat troublesome
daughters of the church press close to kiss the amethystine
ring.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was passing out of the
vicarage gate. The new brood of warblers that
flitted about the tall bushes at that spot heard&mdash;with
perfect unconcern&mdash;a mysterious Latin quotation
issue from that restrained mouth. They could
hardly be blamed for not understanding, even though
they had migrated to these fields of heresy from more
classic places, that the plain English interpretation
of the dark saying was that all things are lawful to
him whose motive is the “Potestas Civitatis Dei!”</p>

<p>He crossed the dusty road and was proceeding
towards his own house, which was hardly more than
a hundred yards away, when he saw through a wide
gap in the hedge a pleasant and familiar sight. It
was a hay-field, in the final stage of its “making,”
surrendering to a great loose stack, built up beneath
enormous elm-trees, the last windrows of its sweet-scented
harvest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Pausing for a moment to observe more closely this
pleasant scene&mdash;for hay-making in Dorsal Field
amounted to a village ritual&mdash;Mr. Taxater became
aware that among the figures scattered in groups
about the meadow were the very two whose relation
to one another he had just been discussing. Vennie
and the young clergyman were engaged in an animated
conversation with three of the farm-boys.</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater at once climbed through the gap, and
crossing the field approached the group unobserved.
It was not till he was quite close that Vennie caught
sight of him. Her pale, pinched little face, under its
large hat, flushed slightly as she held out her hand;
but her great steady grey eyes were full of friendly
welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. Clavering too was effusive and demonstrative
in his greeting. They chatted a little of indifferent
matters, and the theologian was introduced to the
shy farm-boys, who stared at him in rustic wonder.</p>

<p>Then Hugh Clavering said, “If you’ll pardon me
for a moment, I think I ought to go across and speak
to John Goring,” and he indicated the farmer’s
figure bending over a new gleaning-machine, at the
opposite end of the field. “Don’t go away, please,
Mr. Taxater, till I come back. You will keep him,
won’t you, Miss Seldom?”</p>

<p>He strode off; and the boys drifted away after
him, leaving Mr. Taxater and the girl together,
under the unfinished hay-stack. “I was so much
wanting to speak to you,” began Vennie at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
“I very nearly ran in to the Gables; but I saw Mrs.
Wotnot over the wall, and she told me you were
out. I am in serious need of advice upon a thing
that is troubling me, and you are the only person
who can really help.”</p>

<p>The expression of Mr. Taxater’s face at that moment
was so sympathetic, and yet so grave, that one
would hardly have been surprised to hear him utter
the conventional formula of a priest awaiting confession.
Though unuttered, the sacred formula must
have been telepathically communicated, for Vennie
continued without a pause, holding her hands behind
her back, and looking on the ground. “Ever since
our last serious conversation&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;after
Easter, I have been thinking so much about
that phrase of yours, referring to the Pope, as the
eternal living defender of the idea of Love as the
secret of the universe. Mr. Clavering talks to
me about love&mdash;you know what I mean,” she smiled
and blushed prettily, with a quick lifting of her head,
“but he never gives me the feeling of something real
and actual which we can approach on earth&mdash;something
personal, I mean. And I have been feeling so
much lately that this is what I want. Mr. Clavering
is very gentle with me when I try to explain my
difficulties to him; but I don’t think he really understands.
The way he talks is beautiful and inspiring&mdash;but
it somehow sounds like poetry. It does not
give me anything to lay hands on.” And she looked
into Mr. Taxater’s face with a pathetic wide-eyed
appeal, as if he were able to call down angels from
heaven.</p>

<p>“Dear child,” said the diplomatist, “I know only
too well what you mean. Yes, that is the unfortunate
and necessary limitation of a heretical church.
It can only offer mystic and poetic consolations. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
has lost touch with the one true Vine, and consequently
the full stream of life-giving sap cannot flow
through its veins.”</p>

<p>“But I have felt so strengthened,” said Vennie
mournfully, “by the sacrament in our Church; so
strengthened and inspired! It seems dreadful that
it should all be a sort of mockery.”</p>

<p>“Do not speak like that, dear child,” said Mr.
Taxater. “God is good; and in his knowledge of
our weakness he permits us to taste of his mystery
even in forbidden cups. The motive in your heart,
the faith in your soul, have been pure; and God has
given to them some measure, though but an imperfect
one, of what he will grant to your complete
obedience.”</p>

<p>Vennie bent down and picking up a swathe of
sweet-scented hay twisted it thoughtfully in her
fingers. “God has indeed been working miracles on
your behalf,” continued Mr. Taxater. “It must have
been your guardian angel that led me to speak to
you as I did at that time. For in future, I regret
to say, I shall be less free. But the good work has
been done. The seed has been sown. What follows
must be at your own initiative.”</p>

<p>Vennie looked at him, puzzled, and rather alarmed.
“Why do you say you will be less free? Are we
going to have no more lovely conversations at the
bottom of our orchard? Are you going to be too
busy to see me at all?”</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater smiled. “Oh no, it isn’t as bad as
that,” he said. “It is only that I have just faithfully
promised your mother not to convert you to
Catholicism.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mother had no right to make you give any such
promise,” cried the girl indignantly.</p>

<p>“No,” responded the diplomatist, “she had no
such right. No one has a right to demand promises
of that kind. It is one of the worst and subtlest
forms of persecution.”</p>

<p>“But you did not promise? You surely did not
promise?”</p>

<p>“There was no escaping it,” replied Mr. Taxater.
“If I had not done so she would have given you no
peace, and your future movements would have been
mercilessly watched. However,” he went on, smilingly,
“a promise exacted under that kind of compulsion
must be interpreted in a very large and
liberal way. Relatively I must avoid discussing
these things with you. In a higher and more absolute
sense we will combine our thoughts about them,
day and night, until we worship at the same altar.”</p>

<p>Vennie was silent. The noble and exalted sophistry
of the subtle scholar puzzled and bewildered her.
“But I have no idea of what to do next,” she protested.
“I know no Catholics but you. I should
feel very nervous on going to the priest in Yeoborough.
Besides, I don’t at all like the look of him.
And the people here say he is often drunk. You
wouldn’t send me to a man like that, would you?
Oh, I feel so angry with mother! She had no right
to go to you behind my back.”</p>

<p>Francis Taxater laid his hand gently on the girl’s
shoulder. “There is no reason for haste,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
“There is no cause to agitate yourself. Just remain
quietly as you are. Say nothing to your mother.
It would only cause her unnecessary distress. I
never promised not to lend you books. All my
shelves are at your service. Read, my dear Vennie,
read and think. My books will supply the place of
my words. Indeed, they will serve the purpose much
better. In this way we shall at once be obeying
your earthly mother, and not disobeying your heavenly
mother, who is now&mdash;Ave Maria gratiæ plena!&mdash;drawing
you so strongly towards her.”</p>

<p>“Shall I say anything to Mr. Clavering?”</p>

<p>“Not a word! not a word! And enter as little as
possible into argument with him. If he fancies, from
your silence, that he has quelled your doubts, let
him fancy so. The mistake will be due to his own
pride and not to any deception. It is wrong to lie&mdash;but
we are not called upon to dispel illusions arising
from the self-conceit of others.”</p>

<p>“But you&mdash;will&mdash;think&mdash;of me?” pleaded little
Vennie. “I may know that you have not deserted
me? That you are always ready&mdash;always there?”</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater smiled benignly. “Of course I shall
be ready, dear child. And you must be ready. That
is why I only ask you to read and think. God will
answer your prayers if you show patience. He has
taught his church never to clamour for hurried conversions.
But to wait, with all her reservoirs of mysteries,
till they come to her of their own accord.
You will come, Vennie, you will come! But it will be
in God’s hour and not in ours.”</p>

<p>Vennie Seldom thanked him with a timid glance of
infinite gratitude and confidence. A soft luminous
happiness suffused her being, into which the scents
and sounds of that felicitous hour poured their offerings
of subtle contentment. In after years, in strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and remote places, she never forgot the high thrilling
exultation, calm, yet passionate as an indrawn wave,
of that unrecurring moment.</p>

<p>The security that filled her passed, indeed, only
too quickly away. Her face clouded and a little anxious
frown puckered her narrow white forehead.</p>

<p>“There is something else I wanted to ask you,”
she said hurriedly, “and I must say it quickly because
I am afraid of Mr. Clavering coming back.
It has to do with Mr. Clavering. I do not think
you realize what influence you have over people,
what powerful influence! Mr. Clavering adores you.
He would do anything for you. He respects you as a
thinker. He venerates you as a good man. Now,
Mr. Taxater, please, please, use your influence with
him to save him&mdash;to save him&mdash;” She stopped
abruptly, and a flood of colour rushed to her cheeks.</p>

<p>“To save him from what, dear child? I am afraid
there is no hope of Mr. Clavering coming to our
way of thinking.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that, Mr. Taxater! It’s something else;&mdash;something
to do with his own happiness, with his
own life. Oh, it is so hard for me to tell you!” She
clenched her hands tightly together and looked
steadily away from him as she spoke. “It is that
that dreadful Gladys Romer has been plaguing him
so&mdash;tempting him to flirt with her, to be silly about
her, and all that sort of thing. He does not really
like her at all. That I <em>know</em>. But he is passionate
and excitable, and easily led away by a girl like that.
Oh, it all sounds so absurd, as I say it,” cried poor
Vennie, with cheeks that were by this time flaming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
“but it’s much, much more serious than it sounds.
You see, I know Mr. Clavering very well. I know
how simple and pure-minded he is. And I know how
desperately he prays against being led away&mdash;like
this. Gladys does not care for him really a bit.
She only does it to amuse herself; to satisfy her
wicked, wicked nature! She would like to lead him as
far as she possibly could, and then to turn upon
him and make him thoroughly miserable. She is
the kind of girl&mdash;Oh what am I saying to you, Mr.
Taxater?&mdash;that men always are attracted by. Some
men I believe would even call her beautiful. I don’t
think she’s that at all. I think she is gross, fleshly,
and horrid! But I know what a danger she is to
Mr. Clavering. I know the dreadful struggle that
goes on in his mind; and the horrible temptation she
is to him. I know that after seeing her he always
suffers the most cruel remorse. Now, Mr. Taxater,
use your influence to strengthen him against this
girl’s treachery. She only means him harm, I know
she does! And if a person like you, whom he loves
and admires so much, talked to him seriously about
it, it would be such a help to him. He is so young.
He is a mere boy, and absolutely ignorant of the
world. He does not even realize that the village has
already begun its horrid gossip about them. Do&mdash;do,
do something, Mr. Taxater. It is like that young
Parsifal, in the play, being tempted by the enchantress.”</p>

<p>“But how do they meet?” asked the diplomatist,
with unchanged gravity. “I do not see how they
are ever alone together.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p>“She has arranged it. She is so clever; the bad,
bad girl! She goes to him for confirmation lessons.
He teaches her in his study twice a week&mdash;separately
from the others.”</p>

<p>“But her father is a Unitarian.”</p>

<p>“That does not interfere. She does what she likes
with Mr. Romer. Her game now is to want to be
baptized into our church. She is going to be baptized
first, and then confirmed.”</p>

<p>“And the preparation for baptism is as dangerous
as the preparation for confirmation,” remarked the
scholar; straightening the muscles of his mouth, after
the discipline of St. Ignatius.</p>

<p>“The whole thing is horrible&mdash;dreadful! It frets
me every hour of the day. He is so good and so
innocent. He has no idea where she is leading him.”</p>

<p>“But I cannot prevent her wanting to be baptized,”
said Mr. Taxater.</p>

<p>“You can talk to him,” answered Vennie, with
intense conviction. “You can talk to him and he
will listen to you. You can tell him the danger he
is in of being made miserable for life.” She drew her
breath deeply. “Oh the remorse he will feel; the
horrible, horrible remorse!”</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater glanced across the hay-field. The sun,
a red globe of fire, was resting on the extreme edge
of Leo’s Hill, and seemed like a great blood-shot
eye regarding them with lurid interest. Long cool
shadows, thrown across the field by the elms in the
hedge and by the stack beside them, melted magically
into one another, and made the hillocks of still ungathered
grass soft and intangible as fairy graves.</p>

<p>“I will do my best,” said the scholar. “I will do
my best.” And indicating to Vennie, who was absorbed
in her nervous gratitude, the near approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of the object of their saintly conspiracy, he led her
forward to meet the young clergyman with an appropriate
air of friendly and casual nonchalance.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to have to say it,” was Mr. Clavering’s
greeting, “but that farmer-fellow is the only person in
my parish for whom I have a complete detestation.
I wish to goodness Mr. Romer had never brought
him into the place!”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the look of his back, I must say,”
answered the theologian, following with his eyes the
retreating figure of Mr. John Goring.</p>

<p>“He is,” said the young priest, “without exception
the most repulsive human being I have ever met in
my life. Our worthy Romer is an angel of light
compared with him.”</p>

<p>With Mr. Goring still as their topic, they strolled
amicably together towards the same gap in the hedge,
through which the apologist of the papacy had
emerged an hour before. There they separated;
Vennie returning to the vicarage, and the young
clergyman carrying off Mr. Taxater to supper with
him in his house by the church.</p>

<p>Clavering’s establishment consisted of a middle-aged
woman of inordinate volubility, and the woman’s
daughter, a girl of twelve.</p>

<p>The supper offered by the priest to his guest was
“light and choice”&mdash;nor did it lack its mellow
accompaniment of carefully selected, if not “Attic,”
wine. Of this wine Mr. Taxater did not hesitate to
partake freely, sitting, when the meal was over,
opposite his host at the open window, through which
the pleasant murmurs of the evening, and the voices of
the village-street, soothingly and harmoniously floated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The famous theologian was in an excellent temper.
Rich recondite jests pursued one another from his
smiling lips, and his white hands folded themselves
complacently above the cross on his watch-chain.</p>

<p>Lottie Fringe, the child of Clavering’s servant,
tripped sportively in and out of the room, encouraged
in her girlish coquetries by the amiable scholar.
She was not yet too old to be the kittenish plaything
of the lighter moments of a wise and scholarly man,
and it was pleasant to watch the zest with which the
vicar’s visitor entered into her sportive audacities.
Mr. Taxater made her fill and refill his glass, and
taking her playfully on his knee, kissed her and
fondled her many times. It was the vicar himself,
who finally, a little embarrassed by these levities, sent
the girl off to the kitchen, apologizing to his guest for
the freedom she displayed.</p>

<p>“Do not apologize, dear Mr. Clavering,” said the
theologian. “I love all children, especially when they
are girls. There is something about the kisses of a
young girl&mdash;at once amorous and innocent&mdash;which
reconciles one to the universe, and keeps death at a
distance. Could one for a moment think of death,
when holding a young thing, so full of life and beauty,
on one’s knee?”</p>

<p>The young priest’s face clouded. “To be quite
honest with you, Mr. Taxater,” he murmured, in
a troubled voice, “I cannot say that I altogether
agree. We are both unconventional people, so I may
speak freely. I do not think that one does a child
any good by encouraging her to be playful and
forward, in that particular way. You live with your
books; but I live with my people, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
known so many sad cases of girls being completely
ruined by getting a premature taste for coquetry of
that kind.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, my friend,” answered Mr. Taxater,
“that the worst of all heresies is lodged deep in your
heart.”</p>

<p>“Heresies? God knows,” sighed the priest, “I
have enough evil in my heart&mdash;but heresies? I am
at a loss to catch your meaning.”</p>

<p>In the absence of his playful Clerica&mdash;to use the
Pantagruelian allusion&mdash;the great Homenas of Nevilton
was compelled to fill his “tall-boy of extravagant
wine” with his own hand. He did so, and continued
his explanation.</p>

<p>“By the worst of all heresies I mean the dangerous
Puritan idea that pleasure itself is evil and a thing
detestable to God. The Catholic doctrine, as I
understand it, is that all these things are entirely
relative to the persons concerned. Pleasure in itself
is, in the Aristotelian sense, a supreme good. Everyone
has a right to it. Everyone must have it. The
whole thing is a matter of proportion and expediency.
If an innocent playful game, of the kind you have
just witnessed, was likely in this definite particular
case to lead to harm, then you would be justified in
your anxiety. But there must be no laying down of
hard general rules. There must be no making a
virtue of the mere denying ourselves pleasure.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clavering could hardly wait for his guest to
finish.</p>

<p>“Then, according to your theory,” he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
“it would be right for you, or whoever you will,&mdash;pardon
my making the thing so personal&mdash;to indulge
in casual levities with any pretty barmaid, as long as
you vaguely surmised that she was a sensible girl and
would not be harmed?”</p>

<p>“Certainly it would be right,” replied the papal
apologist, sipping his wine and inhaling the perfume
of the garden, “and not only right, but a plain duty.
It is our duty, Mr. Clavering, to make the world
happier while we live in it; and the way to make
girls happier, especially when their occupations are
laborious, is to kiss them; to give them innocent and
admiring embraces.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are not quite serious, Mr. Taxater,”
said the clergyman. “I have an absurd way of
being direct and literal in these discussions.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, I am serious. Do you not know&mdash;young
puritan&mdash;that some of the noblest spirits in
history have not hesitated to increase the pleasure of
girls’ lives by giving them frequent kisses? In the
Greek days he who could give the most charming kiss
was awarded a public prize. In the Elizabethan days
all the great and heroic souls, whose exquisite wit
and passionate imagination put us still to shame,
held large and liberal views on this matter. In the
eighteenth century the courtly and moral Joseph
Addison used never to leave a coffee-house, however
humble and poor, without bestowing a friendly
embrace upon every woman in it. The religious
Doctor Johnson&mdash;a man of your own faith&mdash;was
notoriously in the habit of taking his prettier visitors
upon his knee, and tenderly kissing them. It is no
doubt due to this fact, that the great lexicographer
was so frequently visited;&mdash;especially by young
Quakers. When we come to our own age, it is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
known that the late Archbishop Taraton, the refuter
of Darwin, was never so happy as when romping
round the raspberry-canes in his garden with a crowd
of playful girls.</p>

<p>“These great and wise men have all recognized the
fact that pleasure is not an evil but a good. A good,
however, that must be used discreetly and according
to the Christian self-control of which God has given
his Church the secret. The senses are not under a
curse, Mr. Clavering. They are not given us simply
to tempt and perplex us. They are given for our
wise and moderate enjoyment.”</p>

<p>Francis Taxater once more lifted his glass to his
lips.</p>

<p>“To the devil with this Protestant Puritanism of
yours! It has darkened the sun in heaven. It is
the cause of all the squalid vice and gross excesses
of our forlorn England. It is the cause of the
deplorable perversities that one sees around one. It
is the cause of that odious hypocrisy that makes
us the laughing-stock of the great civilized nations
of France, Italy and Spain.” The theologian drew
a deep breath, and continued. “I notice, Mr.
Clavering, that you have by your side, still unfinished,
your second glass of wine. That is a mistake.
That is an insult to Providence. Whatever
may be your attitude towards these butterfly-wenches,
it cannot, as a matter of poetic economy, be right
to leave a wine, as delicate, as delicious as this, to
spoil in the glass.</p>

<p>“I suppose it has never occurred to you, Mr. Clavering,
to go and sit, with the more interesting of your
flock, at the Seldom Arms? It never has? So I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
imagined from my knowledge of your uncivilized
English ways.</p>

<p>“The European café, sir, is the universal school
of refined and intellectual pleasure. It was from
his seat in a Roman café&mdash;a place not unknown to
me myself&mdash;that the great Gibbon was accustomed
to survey the summer moon, rising above the
Pantheon.</p>

<p>“It is the same in the matter of wine as in the other
matter. It is your hypocritical and puritanical fear
of pleasure that leads to the gross imbibing of villainous
spirits and the subterranean slavery of prostitution.
If you allowed yourselves, freely, naturally, and
with Christian moderation, to enjoy the admirable
gifts of the supreme giver, there would no longer be
any need for this deplorable plunging into insane vice.
As it is&mdash;in this appalling country of yours&mdash;one
can understand every form of debauchery.”</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Clavering intervened with an
eager and passionate question. He had been listening
intently to his visitor’s words, and his clear-cut, mobile
face had changed its expression more than once during
this long discourse.</p>

<p>“You do not, then, think,” said he, in a tone of
something like supplication, “that there is anything
wrong in giving ourselves up to the intense emotion
which the presence of beauty and charm is able to
excite?”</p>

<p>“Wrong?” said Mr. Taxater. “It is wrong to
suppress such feelings! It is all a matter of proportion,
my good sir, a matter of proportion and common
sense. A little psychological insight will soon
make us aware whether the emotion you speak of is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
likely to prove injurious to the object of our admiration.”</p>

<p>“But oneself&mdash;what about oneself?” cried the
young priest. “Is there not a terrible danger, in all
these things, lest one’s spiritual ideal should become
blurred and blighted?”</p>

<p>To this question Mr. Taxater returned an answer
so formidable and final, that the conversation was
brought to an abrupt close.</p>

<p>“What,” he said, “has God given us the Blessed
Sacraments for?”</p>

<p>Hugh Clavering escorted his visitor to the corner of
the street and bade him good-night there. As he
re-entered his little garden, he turned for a moment to
look at the slender tower of St. Catharine’s church,
rising calm and still into the hot June sky. Between
him and it, flitted like the ghost of a dead Thaïs or
Phryne, the pallid shadow of an impassioned temptress
holding out provocative arms. The form of the
figure seemed woven of all the vapours of unbridled
poetic fantasy, but the heavy yellow hair which most
of all hid the tower from his view was the hair of
Gladys Romer.</p>

<p>The apologist of the papacy strolled slowly and
meditatively back to his own house with the easy
step of one who was in complete harmony both with
gods and men. Above him the early stars began, one
by one, to shine down upon the earth, but as he
glanced up towards them, removing his hat and
passing his hand across his forehead, the great
diplomatist appeared quite untroubled by the ineffable
littleness of all earthly considerations, under the remoteness
of those austere watchers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The barking of dogs, in distant unknown yards,
the melancholy cry of new-shorn lambs, somewhere
far across the pastures, the soft, low, intermittent
breathing, full of whispers and odours, of the whole
mysterious night, seemed only to throw Mr. Taxater
back more completely and securely upon that firm
ecclesiastical tradition which takes the hearts of men
in its hands and turns them away from the Outer
Darkness.</p>

<p>He let himself quietly into the Gables garden, by
the little gate in the wall, and entered his house.
He was surprised to find the door unlocked and
a light burning in the kitchen. The careful Mrs.
Wotnot was accustomed to retire to rest at a much
earlier hour. He found the good woman extended at
full length upon three hard chairs, her head supported
by a bundle of shawls. She was suffering from one
of her chronic rheumatic attacks, and was in considerable
distress.</p>

<p>To a less equable and humane spirit there might
have been something rather irritating than pathetic
about this unexpected finale to a harmonious day.
But Mr. Taxater’s face expressed no sign of any feeling
but that of grave and gentle concern.</p>

<p>With some difficulty, for the muscles of her body
were twisted by nervous spasms, the theologian supported
the old woman up the stairs, to her room
under the eaves. Here he laid her upon the bed, and
for the rest of the night refused to leave her room,
rubbing with his white plump hands her thin old
legs, and applying brandy to her lips at the moments
when the nervous contractions that assailed her
seemed most extreme. The delicate light of dawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
showed its soft bluish pallour at the small casemented
window before the old lady fell asleep; but it was
not till relieved by a woman who appeared, several
hours later, with their morning’s milk, that the
defender of the Catholic Faith in Nevilton retired to
his well-earned repose.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PARIAHS</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Quincunx was digging in his garden.
The wind, a little stronger than on the
previous days and still blowing from the
east, buffeted his attenuated figure and ruffled his
pointed beard, tinged with premature grey. He dug
up all manner of weeds, some large, some small, and
shaking them carefully free of the adhesive earth,
flung them into a wheel-barrow by his side.</p>

<p>It was approaching noon, and in spite of the chilly
gusts of wind, the sun beat down hotly upon the
exposed front of Dead Man’s Cottage. Every now
and then Mr. Quincunx would leave his work; and
retiring into his kitchen, proceed with elaborate
nicety to stir a small pot of broth which simmered
over the fire. He was a queer mixture of epicurean
preciseness and ascetic indifference in these matters,
but, on the whole, the epicurean tendency predominated,
owing to a subtle poetic passion in the eccentric
man, for the symbolic charm of all these little necessities
of life. The lighting of his fire in the morning,
the crackling of the burning sticks, and their fragrant
smell, gave Mr. Quincunx probably as much pleasure
as anything else in the world.</p>

<p>Every bowl of that fresh milk and brown bread,
which, prepared with meticulous care, formed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
staple diet, was enjoyed by him with more ceremonious
concentration than most gourmands devote
to their daintiest meat and wine.</p>

<p>The broiling of his chicken on Sunday was a
function of solemn ritual. Mr. Quincunx bent over
the bird, basting it with butter, in the absorbed
manner of a priest preparing the sacrament.</p>

<p>The digging up of onions or lettuces in his garden,
and the stripping them of their outer leaves, was a
ceremony to be performed in no light or casual haste,
but with a prepared and concentrated spirit.</p>

<p>No profane hand ever touched the little canister of
tea from which Mr. Quincunx, at the same precise
hour every day, replenished his tea-pot.</p>

<p>In all these material things his scrupulous and punctilious
nicety never suffered the smallest diminution.
His mind might be agitated to a point bordering upon
despair, but he still, with mechanical foresight, sawed
the fagots in his wood-shed and drew the water from
his well.</p>

<p>As he pulled up weed after weed, on this particular
morning, his mind was in a state of extreme nervous
agitation. Mr. Romer had called him up the night
before to the House, and had announced that his
present income&mdash;the sum regarded by the recluse as
absolutely secure&mdash;was now entirely to cease, and
in the place of it he was destined to receive, in return
for horrible clerical work performed in Yeoborough,
a considerably smaller sum, as Mr. Romer’s paid
dependent.</p>

<p>The idea of working in an office was more distasteful
to Mr. Quincunx than it is possible to indicate to
any person not actually acquainted with him. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
exquisitely characteristic hand, admirably adapted to
the meticulous diary he had kept for years, was
entirely unsuited to competing with type-writing
machines and machine-like type-writers. The walk
to Yeoborough too,&mdash;a matter of some four or five
miles&mdash;loomed upon him as a hideous purgatory.
Walking tired him much more than working in his
garden; and he had a nervous dread of those casual
encounters and salutations on the way, which the
habitual use of the same road to one’s work necessarily
must imply.</p>

<p>His mind anticipated with hideous minuteness
every detail of his future dreary life. He decided
that even at the cost of the sacrifice of the
last of his little luxuries he would make a point of
going one way at least by train. That walk, twice a
day, through the depressing suburbs of Yeoborough
was more than he could bear to contemplate. It was
characteristic of him that he never for a moment
considered the possibility of an appeal to law.
Law and lawyers were for Mr. Quincunx, with his
instincts of an amiable anarchist, simply the engines
through which the rich and powerful worked their
will upon the weak and helpless.</p>

<p>It was equally characteristic of him that it never
entered his head to throw up his cottage, pack his
scanty possessions and seek his fortune in another
place. It was not only Lacrima that held him from
such a resolution. It was as impossible for him to
think of striking out in a new soil as it would have
been for an aged frog to leave the pond of its nativity
and sally forth across the fields in search of new
waters. It was this inability to “strike out” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
grapple with the world on equal terms, that had
led, in the beginning, to his curious relation to the
Romers. He clung to Susan Romer for no other
reason than that she supplied a link between his
past and his present.</p>

<p>His lips trembled with anger and his hand shook,
as he recalled the interview of the preceding night.
The wife had annoyed him almost more than the
husband. His brutality had been gross and frank.
The lascivious joy of a strong nature, in deliberately
outraging a weaker one, had gleamed forth from his
jeering eyes.</p>

<p>But there had been an unction, an hypocritical
sentimentality, about Mrs. Romer’s tone, that had
made him hate her the more bitterly of the two. The
fact that she also&mdash;stupid lump of fawning obesity
as she was!&mdash;was a victim of this imperial tyrant,
did not in the least assuage him. The helot who is
under the lash hates the helot who crouches by the
master’s chair, more deeply than he hates the master.
It is because of this unhappy law of nature that there
are so few successful revolts among our social Pariahs.
The well-constituted ruler of men divides his serfs
into those who hold the whip and those who are
whipped. Yes, he hated her the most. But how he
hated them both!</p>

<p>The heart of your true Pariah is a strange and
dark place, concealing depths of rancorous animosity,
which those who over-ride and discount such feelings
rarely calculate upon. It is a mistake to assume that
this curious rôle&mdash;the rôle of being a Pariah upon
our planet&mdash;is one confined to the submerged, the
outcast, the criminal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>There are Pariahs in every village. It might be
said that there are Pariahs in every family. The
Pariah is one who is born with an innate inability
to deal vigorously and effectively with his fellow
animals. One sees these unfortunates every day&mdash;on
the street, in the office, at the domestic hearth.
One knows them by the queer look in their eyes;
the look of animals who have been crushed rather
than tamed.</p>

<p>It is not only that they are weaker than the rest
and less effectual. They are <em>different</em>. It is in their
difference that the tragedy of their fate lies. Commonplace
weaklings, who are not born Pariahs, have
in their hearts the same standards, the same ambitions,
the same prejudices, as those who rule the
world. Such weaklings venerate, admire, and even
<em>love</em> the strong unscrupulous hands, the crafty unscrupulous
brains, who push them to and fro like
pawns.</p>

<p>But the Pariah does not venerate the Power
that oppresses him. He despises it and hates it.
Long-accumulated loathing rankles in his heart. He
is crushed but not won. He is penned, like a shorn
sheep; but his thoughts “wander through Eternity.”</p>

<p>And it is this difference, separating him from the
rest, that excites such fury in those who oppress him.
The healthy-minded prosperous man is irritated beyond
endurance by this stranger within the gate&mdash;this
incorrigible, ineffectual critic, cumbering his road.
The mob, too, always ready, like spiteful, cawing
rooks, to fall upon a wounded comrade, howl remorselessly
for his destruction. The Pariah is seldom
able to retain the sweetness of his natural affections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Buffeted by the unconscious brutality of those
about him, he retorts with conscious and unfathomable
hatred. His soul festers and gangrenes within
him, and the loneliness of his place among his fellows
leads him to turn upon them all&mdash;like a rat in
a gin. The pure-minded capable man, perceiving
the rancorous misanthropy of this sick spirit, longs
to trample him into the mud, to obliterate him, to
forget him. But the man whose strength and cunning
is associated with lascivious perversity, wishes
to have him by his side, to humiliate, to degrade, to
outrage. A taste to be surrounded by Pariahs is an
interesting peculiarity of a certain successful class.
Such companionship is to them a perpetual and
pleasing reminder of their own power.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx was a true Pariah in his miserable
combination of inability to strike back at the people
who injured him, and inability to forget their injuries.
He propitiated their tastes, bent to their will, conciliated
their pride, agreed with their opinions, and
hated them with demoniacal hatred.</p>

<p>As he pulled up his weeds in the hot sun, this
particular morning, Maurice Quincunx fantastically
consoled himself by imagining all manner of disasters
to his enemies. Every time he touched with his
hands the soft-crumbling earth, he uttered a kind of
half-conscious prayer that, in precisely such a way,
the foundations of Nevilton House should crumble and
yield. Under his hat&mdash;for he was hypochondriacally
apprehensive about sunstrokes&mdash;flapped and waved
in the wind a large cabbage leaf, placed carefully at
the back of his head to protect his neck as he bent
down. The shadow of this cabbage leaf, as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
thrown across the dusty path, assumed singular and
sinister shapes, giving the impression sometimes that
the head of Mr. Quincunx was gnome-like or goblin-like
in its proportions.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most unfortunate characteristic of
Pariahs is that though they cling instinctively to one
another they are irritated and provoked by each
other’s peculiarities.</p>

<p>This unhappy tendency was now to receive sad
confirmation in our weed-puller’s case, for he was
suddenly interrupted by the appearance at his gate
of Lacrima Traffio.</p>

<p>He rose to meet her, and without inviting her to
pass the entrance, for he was extremely nervous of
village gossip, and one never knew what a casual
passer-by might think, he leant over the low wall
and talked with her from that security.</p>

<p>She seemed in a very depressed and pitiable mood
and the large dark eyes that fixed themselves upon
her friend’s face were full of an inarticulate appeal.</p>

<p>“I cannot endure it much longer,” she said. “It
gets worse and worse every day.”</p>

<p>Maurice Quincunx knew perfectly well what she
meant, but the curious irritation to which I have just
referred drove him to rejoin:</p>

<p>“What gets worse?”</p>

<p>“Their unkindness,” answered the girl with a quick
reproachful look, “their perpetual unkindness.”</p>

<p>“But they feed you well, don’t they?” said the
hermit, removing his hat and rearranging the cabbage-leaf
so as to adapt it to the new angle of the sun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
“And they don’t beat you. You haven’t to scrub
floors or mend clothes. People, like you and I, must
be thankful for being allowed to eat and sleep at all
on this badly-arranged earth.”</p>

<p>“I keep thinking of Italy,” murmured Lacrima.
“I think it is your English ways that trouble me.
I don’t believe&mdash;I can’t believe&mdash;they always mean
to be unkind. But English people are so heartless!”</p>

<p>“You seemed to like that Andersen fellow well
enough,” grumbled Mr. Quincunx.</p>

<p>“How can you be so silly, Maurice?” cried the
girl, slipping through the gate in spite of its owner’s
furtive glances down the road. “How can you be so
silly?”</p>

<p>She moved past him, up the path, and seated herself
upon the edge of the wheel-barrow.</p>

<p>“You can go on with your weeding,” she said, “I
can talk to you while you work.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” murmured Mr. Quincunx, making no
effort to resume his labour, “you naturally find a
handsome fellow like that, a more pleasant companion
than me. I don’t blame you. I understand it very
well.”</p>

<p>Lacrima impatiently took up a handful of groundsel
and spurge from the dusty heap by her side and flung
them into the path.</p>

<p>“You make me quite angry with you, Maurice,”
she cried. “How can you say such things after all
that has happened between us?”</p>

<p>“That’s the way,” jeered the man bitterly, plucking
at his beard. “That’s the way! Go on abusing me
because you are not living at your full pleasure, like a
stall-fed upper-class lady!”</p>

<p>“I shan’t stay with you another moment,” cried
Lacrima, with tears in her eyes, “if you are so unkind.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as he had reduced her to this point, Mr.
Quincunx instantaneously became gentle and tender.
This is one of the profoundest laws of a Pariah’s
being. He resents it when his companion in helplessness
shows a spirit beyond his own, but directly such
a one has been driven into reciprocal wretchedness,
his own equanimity is automatically regained.</p>

<p>After only the briefest glance at the gate, he put
his arms round the girl and kissed her affectionately.
She returned his embrace with interest, disarranging
as she did so the cabbage-leaf in his hat, and causing
it to flutter down upon the path. They leant together
for a while in silence, against the edge of the
wheel-barrow, their hands joined.</p>

<p>Thus associated they would have appeared, to the
dreaded passer-by, in the light of a pair of extremely
sentimental lovers, whose passion had passed into the
stage of delicious melancholia. The wind whirled
the dust in little eddies around them and the sun beat
down upon their heads.</p>

<p>“You must be kind to me when I come to tell you
how unhappy I am,” said the Italian. “You are the
only real friend I have in the world.”</p>

<p>It is sad to have to relate that these tender words
brought a certain thrill of alarm into the heart of
Mr. Quincunx. He felt a sudden apprehension lest
she might indicate that it was his duty to run away
with her, and face the world in remote regions.</p>

<p>No one but a born Pariah could have endured the
confiding clasp of that little hand and the memory
of so ardent a kiss without being roused to an impetuosity
of passion ready to dare anything to make her
its own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of pursuing any further the question of his
friend’s troubles, Mr. Quincunx brought the conversation
round to his own.</p>

<p>“The worst that could happen to me has happened,”
he said, and he told her of his interview with
the Romers the day before. The girl flushed with
anger.</p>

<p>“But this is abominable!” she cried, “simply
abominable! You’d better go at once and talk it
over with Mrs. Seldom. Surely, surely, something
can be done! It is clear they have robbed you of
your money. It is a disgraceful thing! Santa Maria&mdash;what
a country this is!”</p>

<p>“It is no use,” sighed the man helplessly. “Mrs.
Seldom can’t help me. She is poor enough herself.
And she will know as well as I do that in the matter
of law I am entirely in their hands. My aunt had
absolute confidence in Mr. Romer and no confidence
in me. No doubt she arranged it with them that
they were to dole me out the money like a charity.
Mr. Romer did once talk about my <em>lending</em> it to him,
and his paying interest on it, and so forth; but he
managed all my aunt’s affairs, and I don’t know what
arrangement he made with her. My aunt never
liked me really. I think if she were alive now she
would probably support them in what they are doing.
She would certainly say,&mdash;she always used to say&mdash;that
it would do me good to do a little honest
work.” He pronounced the words “honest work”
with concentrated bitterness.</p>

<p>“Probably,” he went on, “Mrs. Seldom would say
the same. I know I should be extremely unwilling to
try and make her see how horrible to me the idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
work of this kind is. She would never understand.
She would think it was only that I wanted to remain
a “gentleman” and not to lose caste. She would
probably tell me that a great many gentlemen have
worked in offices before now. I daresay they have,
and I hope they enjoyed it! I know what these
gentlemen-workers are, and how easy things are made
for them. They won’t be made easy for me. I can
tell you that, Lacrima!”</p>

<p>The girl drew a deep sigh, and walked slowly a few
paces down the path, meditating, with her hands
behind her. Presently she turned.</p>

<p>“Perhaps after all,” she said, “it won’t be as bad
as you fancy. I know the head-clerk in Mr. Romer’s
Yeoborough office and he is quite a nice man&mdash;altogether
different from that Lickwit.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx stroked his beard with a trembling
hand. “Of course I knew you’d say that, Lacrima.
You are just like the rest. You women all think,
at the bottom of your hearts, that men are no good
if they can’t make money. I believe you have an
idea that I ought to do what people call ‘get on a
bit in the world.’ If you think that, it only shows
how little you understand me. I have no intention of
‘getting on.’ I <em>won’t</em> ‘get on’! I would sooner walk
into Auber Lake and end the whole business!”</p>

<p>The suddenness and injustice of this attack really
did rouse the Italian to anger. “Good-bye,” she said
with a dark flash in her eyes. “I see it’s no use
talking to you when you are in this mood. You
have never, <em>never</em> spoken to me in that tone before.
Good-bye! I can open the gate for myself, thank
you.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>She walked away from him and passed out into
the lane. He stood watching her with a queer
haggard look on his face, his sorrowful grey eyes
staring in front of him, as if in the presence of an
apparition. Then, very slowly, he resumed his work,
leaving however the fallen cabbage-leaf unnoticed on
the ground.</p>

<p>The weeds in the wheel-barrow, the straight
banked-up lines of potatoes and lettuces, wore, as he
returned to them, that curious air of forlorn desertion
which is one of nature’s bitterest commentaries upon
the folly of such scenes.</p>

<p>A sickening sense of emptiness took possession of
him, and in a moment or two became unendurable.
He flung a handful of weeds to the ground and ran
impetuously to the gate and out into the lane. It
was too late. A group of farm-labourers laughing
and shouting, and driving before them a herd of
black pigs, blocked up the road. He could not
bring himself to pass them, thus hatless and in his
shirt-sleeves. Besides, they must have seen the girl,
and they would know he was pursuing her.</p>

<p>He returned slowly up the path to his house,
and&mdash;to avoid being seen by the men&mdash;entered
his kitchen, and sat gloomily down upon a chair.
The clock on the mantelpiece ticked with contemptuous
unconcern. The room had that smell
of mortuary dust which rooms in small houses often
acquire in the summer. He sat down once more on a
chair, his hands upon his knees, and stared vacantly
in front of him. A thrush outside the window was
cracking a snail upon a stone. When the shouts of
the men died away, this was the only sound that came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to him, except the continual “tick&mdash;tick&mdash;tick&mdash;tick”
of the clock, which seemed to be occupied in
driving nails into the heavy coffin-lid of every mortal
joy that time had ever brought forth.</p>

<p>That same night in Nevilton House was a night
of wretched hours for Lacrima, but of hours of a
wretchedness more active than that which made the
hermit of Dead Man’s Cottage pull the clothes over
his head and turn his face to the wall, long ere the
twilight had vanished from his garden.</p>

<p>On leaving her friend thus abruptly, her heart full
of angry revolt, Lacrima had seen the crowd of men
and animals approaching, and to escape them had
scrambled into a field on the border of the road.
Following a little path which led across it, and crossing
two more meadows, she flung herself down under
the shadow of some great elms, in a sort of grassy
hollow beneath an overgrown hedge, and gave full
vent to her grief. The hollow in which she hid
herself was a secluded and lonely spot, and no sound
reached her but the monotonous summer-murmur of
the flies and the rustle of the wind-troubled branches.
Lying thus, prone on her face, her broad-brimmed hat
with its poppy-trimmings thrown down at her side,
and her limbs trembling with the violence of her
sobs, Lacrima seemed to insert into that alien landscape
an element of passionate feeling quite foreign
to its sluggish fertility. Not alien to the spot, however,
was another human form, that at the same hour
had been led to wander among those lush meadows.</p>

<p>The field behind the high bank and thick-set hedge
which overshadowed the unhappy girl, was a large
and spacious one, “put up,” as country people say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
“for hay,” but as yet untouched by the mowers’
machines. Here, in the heat of the noon, walked the
acquisitive Mr. John Goring, calculating the value of
this crop of grass, and deciding upon the appropriate
date of its cutting.</p>

<p>What curious irony is it, in the blind march of
events, which so frequently draws to the place of our
exclusive sorrow the one particular spectator that we
would most avoid? One talks lightly of coincidence
and of chance; but who that has walked through life
observingly has not been driven to pause with sad
questioning before accidents and occurrences that
seem as though some conscious malignity in things
had <em>arranged</em> them? Are there, perhaps, actual telepathic
vibrations at work about us, drawing the
hunter to his prey&mdash;the prey to the hunter? Is
the innocent object of persecution, hiding from its
persecutors, compelled by a fatal psychic law&mdash;the
law of its own terror&mdash;to call subconsciously upon
the very power it is fleeing from; to betray, against
its will, the path of its own retreat? Lacrima in any
case, as she lay thus prostrate, her poppy-trimmed
hat beside her, and her brown curls flecked with spots
of sun and shadow, brought into that English landscape
a strangely remote touch,&mdash;a touch of tragic
and passionate colour. A sweet bruised exile, she
seemed, from another region, flung down, among all
this umbrageous rankness, to droop like a transplanted
flower. Certainly the sinister magic, whatever
it was, that had drawn Mr. Goring in that fatal
direction, was a magic compounded of the attraction
of contrary elements.</p>

<p>If Mr. Romer represented the occult power of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
sandstone hill, his brother-in-law was the very
epitome and culmination of the valley’s inert clay.
The man breathed clay, looked clay, smelt clay,
understood clay, exploited clay, and in a literal sense
<em>was</em> clay.</p>

<p>If there is any truth in the scientific formula
about the “survival” of those most “adapted” to
their “environment,” Mr. Goring was sure of a
prolonged and triumphant sojourn on this mortal
globe. For his “environment” was certainly one of
clay&mdash;and to clay he certainly was most prosperously
“adapted.”</p>

<p>It was not long before the tragic sobs of the unhappy
Lacrima, borne across the field on the east-wind,
arrested the farmer’s attention. He stood still,
and listened, snuffing the air, like a great jungle-boar.
Then with rapid but furtive steps he crossed over to
where the sound proceeded, and slipping down
cautiously through a gap in the hedge, made his way
towards the secluded hollow, breathing heavily like
an animal on a trail.</p>

<p>Her fit of crying having subsided, Lacrima turned
round on her back, and remained motionless, gazing
up at the blue sky. Extended thus on the ruffled
grass, her little fingers nervously plucking at its roots
and her breast still heaving, the young girl offered a
pitiful enough picture to any casual intruder. Slight
and fragile though she was, the softness and charm of
her figure witnessed to her Latin origin. With her
dusky curls and olive complexion, she might, but for
her English dress, have been taken for a strayed
gipsy, recovering from some passionate quarrel with
her Romany lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Miss Lacrima?” was the
farmer’s greeting as his gross form obtruded itself
against the sky-line.</p>

<p>The girl started violently, and scrambled rapidly
to her feet. Mr. Goring stepped awkwardly down
the grassy slope and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” he said without removing his hat.
“I should have thought ’twas time for you to be up
at the House. ’Tis past a quarter of one.”</p>

<p>“I was just resting,” stammered the girl. “I hope
I have not hurt your grass.” She looked apprehensively
down at the pathetic imprint on the ground.</p>

<p>“No, no! Missie,” said the man. “That’s nothing.
’Tis hard to cut, in a place like this. May-be they’ll
let it alone. Besides, this field ain’t for hay. The
cows will be in here tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Lacrima looked at the watch on her wrist.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right,” she said. “I am late. I
must be running back. Your brother does not like
our being out when he comes in to lunch.” She
picked up her hat and made as if she would pass him.
But he barred her way.</p>

<p>“Not so quick, lassie, not so quick,” he said.
“Those that come into farmers’ fields must not
be too proud to pass the time of day with the
farmer.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he permitted his little voracious pig’s
eyes to devour her with an amorous leer. All manner
of curious thoughts passed through his head. It was
only yesterday that his brother-in-law had been talking
to him of this girl. Certainly it would be extremely
satisfactory to be the complete master of
that supple, shrinking figure, and of that frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
little bosom, that rose and fell now, like the heart of
a panting hare.</p>

<p>After all, she was only a sort of superior servant,
and with servants of every kind the manner of
the rapacious Mr. Goring was alternately brutal and
endearing. Encouraged by the isolation of the spot
and the shrinking alarm of the girl, he advanced still
nearer and laid a heavy hand upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come, little wench,” he said, “I will answer for it
if you’re late, up at the House. Sit down a bit with
me, and let’s make ourselves nice and comfortable.”</p>

<p>Lacrima trembled with terror. She was afraid to
push him away, and try to scramble out of the
hollow, lest in doing so she should put herself still
further at his mercy. She wondered if anyone in the
road would hear if she screamed aloud. Her quick
Latin brain resorted mechanically to a diplomatic
subterfuge. “What kind of field have you got over
that hedge?” she asked, with a quiver in her voice.</p>

<p>“A very nice field for hay, my dear,” replied the
farmer, removing his hand from her shoulder and
thinking in his heart that these foreign girls were
wonderfully easy to manage.</p>

<p>“I’ll show it to you if you like. There’s a pretty
little place for people like you and me to have a chat
in, up along over there.” He pointed through the
hedge to a small copse of larches that grew green and
thick at the corner of the hay-field.</p>

<p>She let him give her his hand and pull her out of
the hollow. Quite passively, too, she followed him,
as he sought the easiest spot through which he might
help her to surmount the difficulties of the intervening
hedge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>When he had at last decided upon the place,
“Go first, please, Mr. Goring,” she murmured,
“and then you can pull me up.”</p>

<p>He turned his back upon her and began laboriously
ascending the bank, dragging himself forward by the
aid of roots and ferns. It had been easy enough to
slide down this declivity. It was much less easy to
climb up. At length, however, stung by nettles and
pricked by thorns, and with earth in his mouth, he
swung himself round at the top, ready to help her to
follow him.</p>

<p>A vigorous oath escaped his lips. She was already
a third of the way across the field, running
madly and desperately, towards the gate into
the lane.</p>

<p>Mr. Goring shook his fist after her retreating figure.
“All right, Missie,” he muttered aloud, “all
right! If you had been kind to the poor farmer,
he might have let you off. But now”&mdash;and he dug
his stick viciously into the earth&mdash;“There’ll be no
dilly-dallying or nonsense about this business. I’ll
tell Romer I’m ready for this marriage-affair as soon
as he likes. I’ll teach you&mdash;my pretty darling!”</p>

<p>That night the massive Leonian masonry of Nevilton
House seemed especially heavy and antipathetic
to the child of the Apennines, as it rose, somnolent
and oppressive about her, in the hot midsummer air.</p>

<p>In their spacious rooms, looking out upon the east
court with its dove-cotes and herbacious borders,
the two girls were awake and together.</p>

<p>The wind had fallen, and the silence about the
place was as oppressive to Lacrima’s mind as the
shadow of some colossal raven’s wing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The door which separated their chambers was
ajar, and Gladys, her yellow hair loose upon her
shoulders, had flung herself negligently down in a
deep wicker-chair at the side of her companion’s bed.</p>

<p>The luckless Pariah, her brown curls tied back
from her pale forehead by a dark ribbon, was lying
supine upon her pillows with a look of troubled terror
in her wide-open eyes. One long thin arm lay upon
the coverlet, the fingers tightened upon an open book.</p>

<p>At the beginning of her “visit” to Nevilton House
she had clung desperately to these precious night-hours,
when the great establishment was asleep;
and she had even been so audacious as to draw the
bolt of the door which separated her from her cousin.
But that wilful young tyrant had pretended to her
mother that she often “got frightened” in the night,
so orders had gone out that the offending bolt should
be removed.</p>

<p>After this, Gladys had her associate quite at
her mercy, and the occasions were rare when the
pleasure of being allowed to read herself to sleep
was permitted to the younger girl.</p>

<p>It was curiously irritating to the yellow-haired
despot to observe the pleasure which Lacrima derived
from these solitary readings. Gladys got into
the habit of chattering on, far into the night, so as
to make sure that, when she did retire, her cousin
would be too weary to do anything but fall asleep.</p>

<p>As the two girls lay thus side by side, the one in
her chair, and the other in her bed, under the weight
of the night’s sombre expectancy, the contrast between
them was emphasized to a fine dramatic point.
The large-winged bat that fluttered every now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
then across the window might have caught, if for a
brief moment it could have been endowed with
human vision, a strange sense of the tragic power
of one human being over another, when the restriction
of a common roof compels their propinquity.</p>

<p>One sometimes seeks to delude oneself in the fond
belief that our European domestic hearths are places
of peace and freedom, compared with the dark haunts
of savagery in remoter lands. It is not true! The
long-evolved system that, with us, groups together,
under one common authority, beings as widely
sundered as the poles, is a system that, for all its
external charm, conceals, more often than anyone
could suppose, subtle and gloomy secrets, as dark and
heathen as any in those less favoured spots.</p>

<p>The nervous organization of many frail human animals
is such that the mere fact of being compelled,
out of custom and usage and economic helplessness,
to live in close relation with others, is itself a tragic
purgatory.</p>

<p>It is often airily assumed that the obstinate and
terrible struggles of life are encountered abroad&mdash;far
from home&mdash;in desolate contention with the
elements or with enemies. It is not so! The most
obstinate and desperate struggles of all&mdash;struggles
for the preservation of one’s most sacred identity, of
one’s inmost liberty of action and feeling&mdash;take
place, and have their advances and retreats, their
treacheries and their betrayals, under the hypocritical
calm of the domestic roof. Those who passionately
resent any agitation, any free thought, any legislative
interference, which might cause these fortresses of
seclusion to enlarge their boundaries, forget, in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
poetic idealization of the Gods of the Hearth, that
tragedies are often enacted under that fair consecration
which would dim the sinister repute of Argos or
of Thebes. The Platonic speculations which, all
through human history, have erected their fanciful
protests against these perils, may often be unscientific
and ill-considered. But there is a smouldering passion
of heroic revolt behind such dreams, which it is
not always wise to overlook.</p>

<p>As these two girls, the fair-haired and the dark-haired,
let the solemn burden of the night thus press
unheeded upon them, they would have needed no
fantastic imagination, in an invisible observer, to be
aware of the tense vibration between them of some
formidable spiritual encounter.</p>

<p>High up above the mass of Leonian stone which
we have named Nevilton House, the Milky Way
trailed its mystery of far-off brightness across the
incredible gulfs. What to it was the fact that one
human heart should tremble like a captured bird in
the remorseless power of another?</p>

<p>It was not to this indifferent sky, stretched equally
over all, that hands could be lifted. And yet the
scene between the girls must have appeared, to such
an invisible watcher, as linked to a dramatic contest
above and beyond their immediate human personalities.</p>

<p>In this quiet room the “Two Mythologies” were
grappling; each drawing its strength from forces of an
origin as baffling to reason as the very immensity of
those spaces above, so indifferent to both!</p>

<p>The hatred that Gladys bore to Lacrima’s enjoyment
of her midnight readings was a characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
indication of the relations between the girls. It is
always infuriating to a well-constituted nature to
observe these little pathetic devices of pleasure in
a person who has no firm grip upon life. It excites
the same healthy annoyance as when one sees some
absurd animal that ought, properly speaking, not to
be alive at all, deriving ridiculous satisfaction from
some fantastic movement incredible to sound senses.</p>

<p>The Pariah had, as a matter of fact, defeated her
healthy-minded cousin by using one of those sly
tricks which Pariahs alone indulge in; and had
craftily acquired the habit of slipping away earlier
to her room, and snatching little oases of solitary
happiness before the imperious young woman came
upstairs. It was in revenge for these evasions that
Gladys was even now announcing to her companion
a new and calculated outrage upon her slave’s peace
of mind.</p>

<p>Every Pariah has some especial and peculiar dread,&mdash;some
nervous mania. Lacrima had several innate
terrors. The strongest of all was a shuddering
dread of the supernatural. Next to this, what she
most feared was the idea of deep cold water. Lakes,
rivers, and chilly inland streams, always rather
alarmed than inspired her. The thought of mill-ponds,
as they eddied and gurgled in the darkness,
often came to her as a supreme fear, and the image
of indrawn dark waters, sucked down beneath weirs
and dams, was a thing she could not contemplate
without trembling. It was no doubt the Genoese
blood in her, crying aloud for the warm blue waves
of the Mediterranean and shrinking from the chill
of our English ditches, that accounted for this peculiarity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
The poor child had done her best to conceal
her feeling, but Gladys, alert as all healthy minded
people are, to seize upon the silly terrors of the ill-constituted,
had not let it pass unobserved, and was
now serenely prepared to make good use of it, as a
heaven-sent opportunity for revenge.</p>

<p>It must be noted, that in the centre of the north
garden of Nevilton House, surrounded by cypress-bordered
lawns and encircled by a low hedge of carefully
clipped rosemary, was a deep round pond.</p>

<p>This pond, built entirely of Leonian stone, lent
itself to the playing of a splendid fountain&mdash;a fountain
which projected from an ornamental island,
covered with overhanging ferns.</p>

<p>The fountain only played on state occasions, and
the coolness and depth of the water, combined with
the fact that the pond had a stone bottom, gave the
place admirable possibilities for bathing. Gladys herself,
full of animal courage and buoyant energy, had
made a custom during the recent hot weather of
rising from her bed early in the morning, before the
servants were up, and enjoying a matutinal plunge.</p>

<p>She was a practised swimmer and had been lately
learning to dive; and the sensation of slipping out
of the silent house, garbed in a bathing-dress, with
sandals on her feet, and an opera-cloak over her
shoulders, was thrilling to every nerve of her healthy
young body. Impervious animal as she was, she
would hardly have been human if those dew-drenched
lawns and exquisite morning odours had not at least
crossed the margin of her consciousness. She had
hitherto been satisfied with a proud sense of superiority
over her timid companion, and Lacrima so far,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
had been undisturbed by these excursions, except in
the welcoming of her cousin on her return, dripping
and laughing, and full of whimsical stories of how
she had peeped down over the terrace-wall, and seen
the milk-men, in the field below, driving in their
cattle.</p>

<p>Looking about, however, in her deliberate feline
way, for some method of pleasant revenge, she had
suddenly hit upon this bathing adventure as a heaven-inspired
opportunity. The thought of it when it
first came to her as she languidly sunned herself,
like a great cat, on the hot parapet of the pond, had
made her positively laugh for joy. She would compel
her cousin to accompany her on these occasions!</p>

<p>Lacrima was not only terrified of water, but was
abnormally reluctant and shy with regard to any risk
of being observed in strange or unusual garments.</p>

<p>Gladys had stretched herself out on the Leonian
margin of the pond with a thrilling sense of delight
at the prospect thus offered. She would be able to
gratify, at one and the same time, her profound need
to excel in the presence of an inferior, and her insatiable
craving to outrage that inferior’s reserve.</p>

<p>The sun-warmed slabs of Leonian stone, upon which
she had so often basked in voluptuous contentment
seemed dumbly to encourage and stimulate her in
this heathen design. How entirely they were the
accomplices of all that was dominant in her destiny&mdash;these
yellow blocks of stone that had so enriched
her house! They answered to her own blond beauty,
to her own sluggish remorselessness. She loved their
tawny colour, their sandy texture, their enduring
strength. She loved to see them around and about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
her, built into walls, courts, terraces and roofs. They
gave support and weight to all her pretensions.</p>

<p>Thus it had been with an almost mystical thrill of
exultation that she had felt the warmth of the Leonian
slabs caress her limbs, as this new and exciting
scheme passed through her mind.</p>

<p>And now, luxuriously seated in her low chair by
her friend’s side she was beginning to taste the
reward of her inspiration.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, crossing her hands negligently
over her knees, “it is so dull bathing alone. I really
think you’ll have to do it with me, dear! You’ll
like it all right when once you begin. It is only the
effort of starting. The water isn’t so very cold, and
where the sun warms the parapet it is lovely.”</p>

<p>“I can’t, Gladys,” pleaded the other, from her
bed, “I can’t&mdash;I can’t!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, child. Don’t be so silly! I tell you,
you’ll enjoy it. Besides, there’s nothing like bathing
to keep one healthy. Mother was only saying last
night to father how much she wished you would
begin it.”</p>

<p>Lacrima’s fingers let her book slip through them. It
slid down unnoticed upon the floor and lay open there.</p>

<p>She sat up and faced her cousin.</p>

<p>“Gladys,” she said, with grave intensity, “if you
make your mother insist on my doing this, you are
more wicked than I ever dreamed you would be.”</p>

<p>Gladys regarded her with indolent interest.</p>

<p>“It’s only at first the water feels cold,” she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
“You get used to it, after the first dip. I always
race round the lawn afterwards, to get warm. What’s
the matter now, baby?”</p>

<p>These final words were due to the fact that the
Pariah had suddenly put up her hands to her face
and was shaking with sobs. Gladys rose and bent
over her. “Silly child,” she said, “must I kiss its
tears away? Must I pet it and cosset it?”</p>

<p>She pulled impatiently at the resisting fingers, and
loosening them, after a struggle, did actually go so
far as to touch the girl’s cheek with her lips. Then
sinking back into her chair she resumed her interrupted
discourse.</p>

<p>The taste of salt tears had not, it seemed, softened
her into any weak compliance. Really strong and
healthy natures learn the art, by degrees, of proving
adamant, to the insidious cunning of these persuasions.</p>

<p>“Girls of our class,” she announced sententiously,
“must set the lower orders in England an example
of hardiness. Father says it is dreadful how effeminate
the labouring people are becoming. They are
afraid of work, afraid of fresh air, afraid of cold
water, afraid of discipline. They only think of getting
more to eat and drink.”</p>

<p>The Pariah turned her face to the wall and lay
motionless, contemplating the cracks and crevices in
the oak panelling.</p>

<p>Under the same indifferent stars the other Pariah
of Nevilton was also staring hopelessly at the wall.
What secrets these impassive surfaces, near the pillows
of sleepers, could reveal, if they could only
speak!</p>

<p>“Father says that what we all want is more
physical training,” Gladys went on. “This next
winter you and I must do some practising in the
Yeoborough Gymnasium. It is our superior physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
training, father says, which enables us to hold the
mob in check. Just look at these workmen and
peasants, how clumsily they slouch about!”</p>

<p>Lacrima turned round at this. “Your father and
his friends are shamefully hard on their workmen.
I wish they would strike again!”</p>

<p>Gladys smiled complacently. The scene was really
beginning to surpass even what she had hoped.</p>

<p>“Why are you such a baby, Lacrima?” she said.
“Stop a moment. I will show you the things you
shall wear.”</p>

<p>She glided off into her own room, and presently
returned with a child’s bathing dress.</p>

<p>“Look, dear! Isn’t it lucky? I’ve had these in
my wardrobe ever since we were at Eastbourne,
years and years ago. They will not be a bit too
small for you. Or if they are&mdash;it doesn’t matter.
No one will see us. And I’ll lend you my mackintosh
to go out in.”</p>

<p>Lacrima’s head sank back upon her pillows and she
stared at her cousin with a look of helpless terror.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>“You needn’t look so horrified, you silly little
thing. There’s nothing to be afraid of. Besides,
people oughtn’t to give way to their feelings. They
ought to be brave and show spirit. It’s lucky for
you you did come to us. There’s no knowing what
a cowardly little thing you’d have grown into, if
you hadn’t. Mother is quite right. It will do you
ever so much good to bathe with me. You can’t
be drowned, you know. The water isn’t out of your
depth anywhere. Father says every girl in England
ought to learn to swim, so as to be able to rescue
people. He says that this is the great new idea of
the Empire&mdash;that we should all join in making the
race braver and stronger. You are English now, you
know&mdash;not Italian any more. I am going to take
fencing lessons soon. Father says you never can tell
what may happen, and we ought all to be prepared.”</p>

<p>Lacrima did not speak. A vision of a fierce aggressive
crowd of hard, hostile, healthy young persons,
drilling, riding, shooting, fencing, and dragging such
renegades as herself remorselessly along with them,
blocked every vista of her mind.</p>

<p>“I hate the Empire!” she cried at last. Gladys
had subsided once more into her chair&mdash;the little
bathing-suit, symbol of our natural supremacy,
clasped fondly in her lap.</p>

<p>“I know,” she said, “where you get your socialistic
nonsense from. Yes, I do! You needn’t shake your
head. You get it from Maurice Quincunx.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get it from anybody,” protested the
Pariah; and then, in a weak murmur, “it grows up
naturally, in my heart.”</p>

<p>“What is that you’re saying?” cried Gladys.
“Sometimes I think you are really not right in your
mind. You mutter so. You mutter, and talk to
yourself. It irritates me more than I can say. It
would irritate a saint.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>“I am sorry if I annoy you, cousin.”</p>

<p>“Annoy me? It would take more than a little
coward like you to annoy me! But I am not going
to argue about it. Father says arguing is only fit
for feeble people. He says we Romers never argue.
We think, and then we <em>do</em>. I’m going to bed. So
there’s your book! I hope you’ll enjoy it Miss
Socialism!”</p>

<p>She picked up the volume from the floor and flung
it into her cousin’s lap. The gesture of contempt
with which she did this would admirably have suited
some Roman Drusilla tossing aside the culture of
slaves.</p>

<p>An hour later the door between the two rooms
was hesitatingly opened, and a white figure stole to
the head of Gladys’ couch. “You’re not asleep, dear,
are you? Oh Gladys, darling! Please, please, please,
don’t make me bathe with you! You don’t know
how I dread it.”</p>

<p>But the daughter of the Romers vouchsafed no
reply to this appeal, beyond a drowsy “Nonsense&mdash;nonsense&mdash;let’s
only pray tomorrow will be fine.”</p>

<p>The night-owls, that swept, on heavy, flapping
wings, over the village, from the tower of St. Catharine’s
Church to the pinnacles of the manor, brought
no miraculous intervention from the resting-place of
the Holy-Rood. What was St. Catharine doing that
she had thus deserted the sanctuary of her name?
Perhaps the Alexandrian saint found the magic of
the heathen hill too strong for her; or perhaps because
of its rank heresy, she had blotted her former
shrine altogether from her tender memory.</p>

<span class="smaller">IDYLLIC PLEASURES</span></h2>

<p>Mortimer Romer could not be called a
many-sided man. His dominant lust for
power filled his life so completely that he
had little room for excursions into the worlds of art
or literature. He was, however, by no means narrow
or stupid in these matters. He had at least the
shrewdness to recognize the depth of their influence
over other people. Indeed, as he was so constantly
occupied with this very question of influence, with
the problem of what precise motives and impulses
did actually stir and drive the average mass of
humanity, it was natural that he should, sooner or
later, have to assume some kind of definite attitude
towards these things. The attitude he finally hit
upon, as most harmonious with his temperament, was
that of active and genial patronage combined with a
modest denial of the possession of any personal
knowledge or taste. He recognized that an occasion
might easily arise, when some association with the
æsthetic world, even of this modest and external
kind, might prove extremely useful to him. He might
find it advisable to make use of these alien forces,
just as Napoleon found it necessary to make use of
religion. The fact that he himself was devoid of
ideal emotions, whether religious or æsthetic, mattered
nothing. Only fools confined their psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
interest within the narrow limits of their
subjective tastes. Humanity was influenced by these
things, and Romer was concerned with influencing
humanity. Not that these deviations into artistic
by-paths carried him very far. He would invite
“cultivated” people to stay with him in his noble
House&mdash;at least they would appreciate that!&mdash;and
then hand them over to the care of his charming
daughter, a method of hospitality which, it must be
confessed, seemed to meet with complete approval
on the part of those concerned. Thus the name of
the owner of Leo’s Hill came to be associated, in
many artistic and literary circles, with the names of
such admirable and friendly patrons of these pursuits,
as could be counted upon for practical and
efficient, if not for intellectual aid, in the contest
with an unsympathetic and materialistic world. It
was not perhaps the more struggling and less prosperous
artists who found him their friend. To most
of these his attitude, though kind and attentive, was
hardly cordial. He knew too little of the questions
at issue, to risk giving his support to the Pariahs
and Anarchists of Art. It was among the well-known
and the successful that Mr. Romer’s patronage was
most evident. Success was a quality he admired in
every field; and while, as has been hinted, his personal
taste remained quite untouched, he was clever
enough to pick up the more fashionable catch-words
of current criticism, and to use them, when
occasion served, with effective naturalness and apparent
conviction.</p>

<p>Among other celebrities or semi-celebrities, across
whose track he came, while on his periodic visits to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
London, was a certain Ralph Dangelis, an American
artist, whose masterly and audacious work was just
then coming into vogue. True to his imperial instinct
of surrounding himself with brilliant and prosperous
clients, if such they could be called, he promptly
invited the famous Westerner to come down and
stay with him in Nevilton.</p>

<p>The American, who knew nothing of English
country life, and was an impassioned and desperate
pursuer of all new experiences, accepted this invitation,
and appeared, among the quiet Somersetshire
orchards, like a bolt from the blue; falling into the
very centre of the small quaintly involved drama,
whose acts and scenes we are now recording. Thus
plunged into a completely new circle the distinguished
adventurer very soon made himself most felicitously
at home. He was of a frank and friendly disposition;
at heart an obdurate and impenetrable egoist, but on
the surface affable and kind to a quite exceptional
degree. He had spent several years in both Paris
and Rome, and hence it was in his power to adapt
himself easily and naturally to European, if not to
English ways. One result of his protracted visits
to foreign cities was the faculty of casting off at
pleasure his native accent&mdash;the accent of a citizen
of Toledo, Ohio. He did not always do this. Sometimes
it was his humour, especially in intercourse with
ladies, to revert to most free and fearless provincialisms,
and a certain boyish gaiety in him made him
mischievously addicted to use such expressions when
they seemed least of all acceptable, but under normal
conditions it would have been difficult to gather from
the tone of his language that he was anything but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
an extremely well-travelled gentleman of Anglo-Saxon
birth. He speedily made a fast friend of
Gladys, who found his airy persiflage and elaborate
courtesy eminently to her liking; and as the long
summer days succeeded one another and brought the
visitor into more and more familiar relation with
Nevilton ways and customs, it seemed as though his
sojourn in that peaceful retreat was likely to be indefinitely
prolonged. It may be well believed that
their guest’s attraction to Gladys did not escape
the notice of the girl’s parents. Mr. Romer took
the trouble to make sundry investigations as to the
status of Mr. Dangelis in his native Ohio; and it
was with unmixed satisfaction that both he and his
wife received the intelligence that he was the son
and the only son of one of Toledo’s most “prominent”
citizens, a gentleman actively and effectively
engaged in furthering the progress of civilization by
the manufacturing of automobiles. Dangelis was,
indeed, a prospective, if not an actual, millionaire,
and, from all that could be learned, it appeared that
the prominent citizen of Toledo handed over to his
son an annual allowance equal to the income of
many crowned heads.</p>

<p>The Pariah of Nevilton House&mdash;the luckless child
of the Apennines&mdash;found little to admire in this
energetic wanderer. His oratorical manner, his
abrupt, aggressive courtesies, his exuberant high
spirits, the sweep and swing of his vigorous personality,
the extraordinary mixture in him of pedantry
and gaiety, jarred upon her sensitive over-strung
nerves. In his boyish desire to please her, hearing
that she came from Italy, the good-natured artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
would frequently turn the conversation round to the
beauty and romance of that “garden of the world,”
as he was pleased to style her home; but the tone
of these discourses increased rather than diminished
Lacrima’s obstinate reserve. He had a habit of referring
to her country as if it were a place whose
inhabitants only existed, by a considerate dispensation
of Providence, to furnish a charming background
for certain invaluable relics of antiquity.
These precious fragments, according to this easy
view of things, appeared to survive, together with
their appropriate guardians, solely with the object
of enlarging and inspiring the voracious “mentality”
of wayfarers from London and New York. Grateful
as Lacrima was for the respite the artist brought her
from the despotism of her cousin, she could not
bring herself to regard him, so far as she herself was
concerned, with anything but extreme reserve and
caution.</p>

<p>One peculiarity he displayed, filled her with shy
dismay. Dangelis had a trick of staring at the people
with whom he associated, as if with a kind of quizzical
analysis. He threw her into a turmoil of
wretched embarrassment by some of his glances.
She was troubled and frightened, without being able
to get at the secret of her agitation. Sometimes she
fancied that he was wondering what he could make
of her as a model. The idea that anything of this
kind should be expected of her filled her with nervous
dread. At other times the wild idea passed through
her brain that he was making covert overtures to
her, of an amorous character. She thought she intercepted
once or twice a look upon his face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
particular kind which always filled her with shrinking
apprehension. This illusion&mdash;if it were an illusion&mdash;was
far more alarming than any tendency he
might display to pounce on her for æsthetic purposes;
for the Pariah’s association with the inhabitants of
Nevilton House had not given her a pleasing impression
of human amorousness.</p>

<p>Shortly after Dangelis’ arrival, Mr. Romer found
it necessary to visit London again for a few days;
and the artist was rather relieved than otherwise by
his departure. He felt freer, and more at liberty
to express his ideas, when left alone with the three
women. For himself, however varied their attitude
to him might be, he found them all, in their different
ways, full of stimulating interest. With Mrs. Romer
he soon became perfectly at home; and discovered a
mischievous and profane pleasure in the process of
exciting and encouraging all her least lady-like characteristics.
He would follow her into the spacious
Nevilton kitchens, where the good lady was much more
at home than in her stately drawing room; and watch
with unconventional interest her rambling domestic
colloquies with Mrs. Murphy the housekeeper, Jane
the cook, and Lily the house-maid.</p>

<p>The men-servants, of whom Mr. Romer kept two,
always avoided, with scrupulous refinement, these
unusual gatherings. They discoursed, in the pantry,
upon their mistress’ dubious behavior, and came to
the conclusion that she was no more of a “real lady”
than her visitor from America was a “real gentleman.”</p>

<p>Dangelis made some new and amazing discovery
in Susan Romer’s character every day. In all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
experiences from San Francisco to New York, and
from Paris to Vienna, he had never encountered
anything in the least resembling her.</p>

<p>He could never make out how deep her apparent
simplicity went, nor how ingrained and innate was
her lethargic submission to circumstances. Nothing
in the woman shocked him; neither her vulgarity
nor her grossness. And as for her sly, sleepy, feline
malice, he loved to excite and provoke it, as he would
have loved to have excited a slumbering animal in a
cage. He delighted in the way she wrinkled up her
eyes. He delighted in the way she smacked her lips
over her food. He loved watching her settling herself
to sleep in her high-backed Sheraton chair in
the kitchen, or in her more modern lounge in the
great entrance hall. He never grew tired of asking
her questions about the various personages of Nevilton,
their relation to Mr. Romer, and Mr. Romer’s
relation to them. He used to watch her sometimes,
as in drowsy sensual enjoyment she would bask in
the hot sunshine on the terrace, or drift in her slow
stealthy manner about the garden-paths, as if she
were a great fascinating tame puma. He made endless
sketches of her, in his little note-books, some of
them of the most fantastic, and even Rabelaisean
character. He had certainly never anticipated just
this, when he accepted the shrewd financier’s invitation
to his Elizabethan home. And if Susan Romer
delighted him, Gladys Romer absolutely bewitched
him. He treated her as if she were no grown-up
young lady, but a romping and quite unscrupulous
child; and the wily Gladys, quickly perceiving how
greatly he was pleased by any naive display of youthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
malice, or greed, or sensuality, or vanity, took good
care to put no rein upon herself in the expression of
her primitive emotions.</p>

<p>It was with Lacrima that Ralph Dangelis found himself
on ground that was less secure, but in the genial
aplomb of his all-embracing good-fellowships, it was
only by degrees that he became conscious even of this.
He found the place not only extraordinarily harmonious
to his general temper, but extremely inspiring to
his imaginative work. It only needed the securing of
a few mechanical contrivances, a studio, for instance,
with a north-light, to have made his sojourn at Nevilton
one of the most prolific summers, in regard to
his art, that he had experienced since his student days
in Rome. He began vaguely to wish in the depths
of his mind that it were possible for these good
Romers to bestow upon him in perpetuity some
pleasant airy chamber in their great house, so that he
might not have to lose, for many summers to come,
these agreeable and scandalous gossippings with the
mother and these still more agreeable flirtations with
the delicious daughter. This bold and fantastic idea
was less a fabric of airy speculation than might have
been supposed; for if the American was enchanted
with his entertainers, his entertainers, at any rate the
mother and the daughter, were extremely well pleased
with him. The free sweep of his capacious sympathy,
the absence in him of any punctilious gentility, the
large and benignant atmosphere he diffused round
him, and the mixture of cynical realism with considerate
chivalry, were things so different from anything
they had been accustomed to, that they both
of them would willingly have offered him a suite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
apartments in the house, if he could have accepted
such an offer.</p>

<p>Dangelis was particularly lucky in arriving at
Nevilton at this especial moment. An abnormally
retarded spring had led to the most delicious overlapping
in the varied flora of the place. Though June
had begun, there were still many flowers lingering in
the shadier spots of the woods and ditches, which
properly belonged not only to May, but to very
early May. Certain, even, of April’s progeny had
not completely faded from the late-flowering lanes.</p>

<p>The artist found himself surrounded by a riotous
revel of leafy exuberance. The year’s “primal burst”
had occurred, not in reluctant spasmodic fits and
starts, as is usual in our intermittent fine weather,
but in a grand universal outpouring of the earth’s
sap. His imagination answered spontaneously to
this appeal, and his note-books were speedily filled
with hurried passionate sketches, made at all hours
of the long bright days, and full of suggestive charm.
One particularly lovely afternoon the American found
himself wandering slowly up the hill from the little
Nevilton station, after a brief excursion to Yeoborough
in search of pigments and canvas. He was hoping
to take advantage of this auspicious stirring of his
imaginative senses, by entering upon some more
important and more continuous work. The Nevilton
ladies had assured him that it would be quite impossible
to find in the little town the kind of materials he
needed; and he was returning in high spirits to assure
them that he had completely falsified their prediction.
He suspected Gladys of having invented this difficulty
with a view to confining his labours to such easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
shared sketching-trips as she might accompany him
upon, but though the fascination of the romping and
toying girl still retained, and had even increased, its
power over him; he was, in this case, impelled and
driven by a force stronger and more dominant than
any sensual attraction. He was in a better mood for
painting than he had ever been in his life, and nothing
could interfere with his resolution to exploit this mood
to its utmost limit. With the most precious of his
newly purchased materials under his arm and the more
bulky ones promised him that same evening, Dangelis,
as he drifted slowly up the sunny road chatting
amicably with such rural marketers as overtook him,
felt in a peculiarly harmonious temper.</p>

<p>He had recently, in the western cities of the States,
won a certain fiercely contested notoriety in the art
of portrait-painting, an art which he had come more
and more to practise according to the very latest
of those daring modern theories, which are summed
up sometimes under the not very illuminative title
of Post-impressionism, and he had, during the last
few days, indulged in a natural and irresistible wish
to associate this new departure with his personal
experiences at Nevilton.</p>

<p>Gossiping nonchalantly with the village-wives, as
he ascended the dusty road, by the vicarage wall, his
thoughts ran swiftly over the motley-coloured map of
his past life, and the deviating track across the world
which he had been led to follow. He congratulated
himself in his heart, as he indulged in easy persiflage
with his fellow-wayfarers, upon his consistent freedom
from everything that might choke or restrain the
freedom of his will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>How fortunate, how incredibly fortunate, that he
should, in weather like this, and in so abounding a
mood of creative energy, be completely his own
master, except for the need of propitiating two naive
and amusing women! He entertained himself by the
thought of how little they really knew him,&mdash;these
friendly Romers&mdash;how little they sounded his real
purposes, his essential feelings! To them no doubt,
he was no more than he was to these excellent villagers,&mdash;a
tall, fair, slouching, bony figure, with a
face,&mdash;if they went as far as his face,&mdash;massively
heavy and irregular, with dreamy humorous eyes and
a mouth addicted to nervous twitching.</p>

<p>A clump of dandelions, obtruding their golden
indifference to human drama, into the dust of the
road at his feet, mixed oddly, at that moment, in
these obscure workings of his brain, with a sort of
savage caress of self-complacent congratulation which
he suddenly bestowed on his interior self; as, beneath
his pleasant chatter with his rural companions,
he thought how imperturbable, how ferocious, his
secret egoism was, and how well he concealed it
under his indolent good-nature! He had passed now
the entrance to the vicarage garden, and in the
adjoining field he observed with a curious thrill of
psychic sympathy the tenacious grip with which a
viciously-knotted ash-tree held to the earth with
its sturdy roots. Out-walked at last by all the other
returned travellers, Dangelis glanced without pausing
down the long Italianated avenue, at the end of
which shone red, in the afternoon sun, the mullioned
windows of the great house. He preferred to prolong
his stroll, by taking the circuitous way, round by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
village. He knew the expression of that famous
west front too well now, to linger in admiration over
its picturesque repose in the afternoon sunshine.
As a matter of fact a slight chill of curious antipathy
crossed his consciousness as he quickened his steps.</p>

<p>Happily situated though he was, in his pleasant
lodging beneath that capacious roof, the famous
edifice itself had not altogether won his affection. The
thing suggested to his wayward and prairie-nurtured
soul, a stately product rather of convention than of
life. He felt oddly conscious of it as something symbolic
of what would be always intrinsically opposed
to him, of what would willingly, if it were able, suppress
him and render him helpless.</p>

<p>Dangelis belonged to quite a different type of
trans-Atlantic visitor, from the kind that hover with
exuberant delight over everything that is “old” or
“English” or “European.” He was essentially rather
an artist than an antiquary, rather an energetic
workman than an epicurean sentimentalist. Once out
of sight of the Elizabethan pile, the curious chill
passed from his mind, and as he approached the first
cottages of the village he looked round for more
reassuring tokens. Such tokens were not lacking.
They crowded in upon him, indeed, from every side.
Stopping for a moment, ere the houses actually
blocked his view, and leaning over a gate which
faced westward, Dangelis looked out across the great
Somersetshire plain, to which Leo’s Hill and Nevilton
Mount serve the office of watchful sentinels. Tall,
closely-clipped elm-trees, bordering every field, gave
the country on this side of the horizon, a queer artificial
look, as if it had been one huge landscape-garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
arranged according to the arbitrary pleasure
of some fantastic artist, whose perversion it was to
reduce every natural extravagance to the meticulous
rhythm of his own formal taste.</p>

<p>This impression, the impression of something willed
and intentional in the very formation of Nature, gave
our eccentric onlooker a caressing and delicate pleasure,
a sense as of a thing peculiarly harmonious to his
own spirit. The formality of Nevilton House depressed
and chilled him, but the formality of age-trimmed
trees and hedges liberated his imagination,
as some perverse work of a Picasso or a Matisse might
have done. He wondered vaguely to himself what
was the precise cause of the psychic antipathy which
rendered him so cold to the grandeur of Elizabethan
architecture, while the other features of his present
dwelling remained so attractive, and he came to the
temporary solution, as he took his arms from the
top of the gate, that it was because that particular
kind of magnificence expressed the pride of a class,
rather than of an individual, whereas he himself was
all for individual self-assertion in everything&mdash;in
everything! The problem was still teasing him, when,
a few minutes later, he passed the graceful tower of
St. Catharine’s church.</p>

<p>This strangely organic, this curiously anonymous
Gothic art&mdash;was not this also, the suppression of
the individual, in the presence of something larger
and deeper, of something that demanded the sacrifice
of mere transient personality, as the very condition
of its appearance? At all events it was less
humiliating, less of an insult, to the claims of the
individual will, when the thing was done in the interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of religion, than when it was done in the interests
of a class. The impersonality of the former, resembled
the impersonality of rocks and flowers; that
of the latter, the impersonality of fashions in dress.</p>

<p>“But away with them both!” muttered Dangelis
to himself, as he strode viciously down the central
street of Nevilton. The American was in very truth,
and he felt he was, for all his artistic receptivity, an
alien and a foreigner in the midst of these time-worn
traditions. In spite of their beauty he knew himself
profoundly opposed to them. They excited fibres of
opposition and rebellion in him, that went down to
the very depths of his nature. If, allowing full scope
to our speculative fancy&mdash;and who knows upon
what occult truths these wandering thoughts sometimes
stumble?&mdash;we image the opposing “streams of
tendency,” in Nevilton village, as focussed and summed
up, in the form of the Gothic church, guarded by the
consecrated Mount, and the form of the Elizabethan
house, owned by the owner of Leo’s Hill, it is clear
that this wanderer, from the shores of the Great
Lakes, was equally antagonistic to both of them. He
brought into the place a certain large and elemental
indifference. To the child of the winds and storms
of the Great Lakes, as, so one might think, to the
high fixed stars themselves, this local strife of opposed
mythologies must needs appear a matter of but trifling
importance.</p>

<p>The American was not permitted, on this occasion,
to pursue his meditations uninterrupted to the end
of his walk. Half-way down the south drive he was
overtaken by Gladys, returning from the village
post-office. “Hullo! How have you got on?” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
cried. “I suppose you’ll believe me another time?
You know now, I expect, how impossible the Yeoborough
shops are!”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” said the artist smiling, “I have
found them extremely good. Perhaps I am less
exacting,” he added, “than some artists.”</p>

<p>“I am exacting in everything,” said Gladys, “especially
in people. That is why I get on so well
with you. You are a new experience to me.”</p>

<p>Dangelis made no reply to this and they paced in
silence under the tall exotic cedars until they reached
the house.</p>

<p>“There’s mother!” cried the girl, pushing open the
door that led into the kitchen premises, and pulling
the American unceremoniously in after her. They
found Mrs. Romer before a large oak table, set in
the mullioned window of the housekeeper’s little
room. She was arranging flowers for the evening’s
dinner-table. The plump lady welcomed Dangelis
effusively and made him sit down upon a Queen Anne
settle of polished mahogany which stood in the corner
of the fire-place. Gladys remained standing, a tall
softly-moulded figure, appealingly girlish in her light
muslin frock. She swayed slightly, backwards and
forwards, pouting capriciously at her mother’s naive
discourse, and loosening her belt with both her hands.</p>

<p>“Why should you ever go back to America?” Mrs.
Romer was saying. “Don’t go, dear Mr. Dangelis.
Stay with us here till the end of the summer. The
Red room in the south passage was getting quite
damp before you came. Please, don’t go! Gladys
and I are getting so fond of you, so used to your
ways and all that. Aren’t we Gladys? Why should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
you go? There are plenty of lovely bits of scenery
about here. And you can have a studio built! Yes!
Why not? Couldn’t he, Gladys? The lumber-room in
the south passage&mdash;opposite where Lily sleeps&mdash;would
make a splendid place for painting in hot
weather. I suppose a north light, though, would be
impossible. But some kind of glass arrangement
might be made. I must talk to Mortimer about it.
I suppose you rich Americans think nothing of
calling in builders and putting up studios. I suppose
you do it everywhere. America must be full of
north light. But perhaps something of the kind could
be done. I really don’t understand architecture, but
Mortimer does. Mortimer understands everything.
I daresay it wouldn’t be very expensive. It would
only mean buying the glass.”</p>

<p>The admirable woman, whose large fair face and
double chin had grown quite creased and shiny
with excitement, turned at last to her daughter who
had been coquettishly and dreamily staring at the
smiling artist.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say something, Gladys? You don’t
want Mr. Dangelis to go, any more than I do, do
you?”</p>

<p>The girl moved to the table and picking up a large
peony stuck it wantonly and capriciously into her
dress. “I have my confirmation lesson tonight,”
she said. “I must be at Mr. Clavering’s by six.
What’s the time now?” She looked at the clock on
the mantelpiece. “Why, it’s nearly half-past four!
I wonder where Lacrima is. Never mind! We must
have tea without her. I’m sure Mr. Dangelis is
dying for tea. Let’s have it out on the terrace.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“At six?” repeated Mrs. Romer. “I thought the
class was always at seven. It was given out to be
seven. I heard the notice on Sunday.”</p>

<p>Gladys looked smilingly at the American as she
answered her mother. “Don’t be silly, dear. You
know Mr. Clavering takes me separately from the
others. The others are all village people.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romer rose from her seat with something
between a sigh and a chuckle. “I hadn’t the least
idea,” she said, “that he took you separately. You’ve
been going to these classes for three weeks and you’ve
never mentioned such a thing until this moment.
Well&mdash;never mind! I expect Mr. Dangelis will not
object to strolling down the drive with you. You’d
better both get ready for tea now. I’ll go and tell
somebody we want it.”</p>

<p>She had no sooner departed than Gladys began flicking
the American, in playful childish sport, with a
spray of early roses. He entered willingly into the
game, and a pleasant tussle ensued between them
as he sought to snatch the flowers out of her hands.
She resisted but he pushed her backwards, and held
her imprisoned against the edge of the table, teasing
her as if she were a romping child of twelve.</p>

<p>“So you are going to these classes alone, are you?”
he said.  “I see that your English clergymen are
allowed extraordinary privileges. I expect you cause
him a good deal of agitation, poor dear man, if you
flirt with him as shamelessly as you do with me.
Well, go ahead! I’m not responsible for you. In
fact I’m all for spurring you on. It’ll amuse me to
see what happens. But no doubt all sorts of things
have happened already! I suppose you’ve made Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Clavering desperately in love with you. I expect
you persecute him unmercifully. I know you. I
know your ways.” He playfully pinched her arm.
“But go on. It’ll be an amusement to me to watch
the result of all this. I like being a sort of sympathetic
onlooker, in these things. I like the idea of
hiding behind the scenes, and watching the tricks of
a naughty little flirt like you, set upon troubling the
mind of a poor harmless minister.”</p>

<p>The reply made by the daughter of the House to
this challenge was a simple but effective one. Like
a mischievous infant caught in some unpardonable
act, she flagrantly and shamelessly put out her
tongue at him. Long afterwards, with curious feelings,
Dangelis recalled this gesture. He associated
it to the end of his life with the indefinable smell of
cut flowers, with their stalks in water, and the
pungency of peony-petals.</p>

<p>Tea, when it reached our friends upon the stately
east terrace, proved a gay and festive meal. The
absence of the reserved and nervous Italian, and also
of the master of Nevilton, rendered all three persons
more completely and freely at their ease, than they
had ever been since the American’s first appearance.
The grass was being cut at that corner of the park,
and the fresh delicious smell, full of the very sap of
the earth, poured in upon them across the sunny
flower beds. The chattering of young starlings, the
cawing of young rooks, blended pleasantly with the
swish of the scythes and the laughter of the hay-makers;
and from the distant village floated softly
to their ears all those vague and characteristic sounds
which accompany the close of a hot day, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
release from labour of men and beasts. As they
devoured their bread and butter with that naive
greediness which is part of the natural atmosphere
of this privileged hour in an English home, the three
friends indicated by their playful temper and gay
discourse that they each had secret reasons for self-congratulation.</p>

<p>Dangelis felt an exquisite sense of new possibilities
in his art, drawn from the seduction of these
surroundings and the frank animalism of his cheerful
companions. He sat between them, watching
their looks and ways, very much as Rubens or
Franz Hals might have watched the rounded bosoms
and spacious gestures of two admirable burgess-women
in some country house of Holland.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romer, below her garrulous chatter, nourished
fantastic and rose-colored dreams, in which inestimable
piles of dollars, and limitless rows of golden
haired grand-children, played the predominant part.
Gladys, flushed and excited, gave herself up to the
imagined exercise of every sort of wanton and wilful
power, with the desire for which the flowing sap of
the year’s exuberance filled her responsive veins.</p>

<p>Tea over, Dangelis suggested that he should accompany
the girl to Mr. Clavering’s door.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be there for three quarters of an
hour,” he said, “let’s go across to the mill copse
first, and see if there are any blue-bells left.”</p>

<p>Gladys willingly consented, and Susan Romer,
remaining pensive in her low cane chair, watched
their youthful figures retreating across the sunlit
park with a sigh of profound thankfulness addressed
vaguely and obscurely to Omnipotence. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
indeed the sort of son-in-law she craved. How much
more desirable than that reserved and haughty young
Ilminster! Gladys would be, three times over, a
fool if she let him escape.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the artist and his girl-friend
reached the mill spinney. He helped her over the
stream and the black thorn hedge without too much
damage to her frock and he was rewarded for his
efforts by the thrill of vibrating pleasure with which
she plunged her hands among the oozy stalks of those
ineffable blue flowers.</p>

<p>“No wonder young Hyacinth was too beautiful
to live,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” was the young woman’s reply, as she
breathlessly stretched herself along the length of a
fallen branch, and endeavoured to reach the damp
moist stalks and cool leaves with her forehead and lips.</p>

<p>“How silly it is, having one’s hair done up,” she
cried presently, raising herself on her hands from her
prone position, and kicking the branch viciously with
her foot.</p>

<p>“You’d have liked me with my hair down, Mr.
Dangelis,” she continued. “Lying like this,” and she
once more embraced the fallen bough, “it would
have got mixed up with all those blue-bells and then
you <em>would</em> have had something to paint!”</p>

<p>“Bad girl!” cried the artist playfully, switching
her lightly with a willow wand from which he had
been stripping the bark. “I would have made you
do your hair up, tight round your head, years and
years ago.”</p>

<p>He offered her his hand and lifted her up. Once in
possession of those ardent youthful fingers, he seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to consider himself justified in retaining them and,
as the girl made no sign of dissent, they advanced
hand in hand through the thick undergrowth.</p>

<p>The place was indeed a little epitome of the season’s
prolific growth. Above and about them, elder-bushes
and hazels met in entangled profusion; while
at their feet the marshy soil was covered with a mass
of moss and cool-rooted leafy plants. Golden-green
burdocks grew there, and dark dog-mercury; while
mixed with aromatic water-mint and ground ivy,
crowds of sturdy red campions lifted up their rose-coloured
heads. The undergrowth was so thick, and
the roots of the willows and alders so betraying, that
over and over again he had to make a path for her,
and hold back with his hand some threatening withy-switch
or prickly thorn branch, that appeared likely
to invade her face or body.</p>

<p>The indescribable charm of the hour, as the broken
sunlight, almost horizontal now, threw red patches,
like the blood of wounded satyrs, upon tree-trunks
and mossy stumps, and made the little marsh-pools
gleam as if filled with fairy wine, found its completest
expression in the long-drawn flute-music, at
the same time frivolously gay and exquisitely sad, of
the blackbird’s song. An angry cuckoo, crying its
familiar cry as it flew, flapped away from some
hidden perch, just above their heads.</p>

<p>Not many more blackbird’s notes and not many
more cuckoo’s cries would that diminutive jungle
hear, before the great midsummer silence descended
upon it, to be broken only by the less magical
sounds of the later season. Nothing but the auspicious
accident of the extreme lateness of the spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
had given to the visitor from Ohio these revelations
of enchantment. It was one of those unequalled
moments when the earth seems to breathe out from
its most secret heart perfumes and scents that seem
to belong to a more felicitous planet than our planet,
murmurs and voices adapted to more responsive ears
than our ears.</p>

<p>It was doubtless, so Dangelis thought, on such an
evening as this, that the first notion of the presence
in such places of beings of a finer and yet a grosser
texture than man’s, first entered the imagination of
humanity. In such a spot were the earth-gods born.</p>

<p>Many feathered things, besides blackbirds and
cuckoos abounded in the mill spinney.</p>

<p>They had scarcely reached the opposite end of the
little wood, when with a sudden cry of excitement
and a quick sinking on her knees, the girl turned to
him with a young thrush in her hand. It was big
enough to be capable of flying and, as she held it in
her soft white fingers, it struggled desperately and
uttered little cries. She held it tightly in one hand,
and with the other caressed its ruffled feathers,
looking sideways at her companion, as she did so,
with dreamy, half-shut, voluptuous eyes.</p>

<p>“Little darling,” she whispered. And then, with
a breathless gasp in her voice,&mdash;“Kiss its head, Mr.
Dangelis. It can’t get away.” He stooped over her
as she held the bird up to him, and if in obeying her
he brushed with his lips fingers as well as feathers,
the accident was not one he could bring himself to
regret.</p>

<p>“It can’t get away,” she repeated, in a low soft
murmur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The bird did, however, get away, a moment afterwards,
and went fluttering off through the brushwood,
with that delicious, awkward violence, which
young thrushes share with so many other youthful
things.</p>

<p>In the deep ditch which they now had to cross, the
artist caught sight of a solitary half-faded primrose,
the very last, perhaps, of its delicate tribe. He
showed it to Gladys, gently smoothing away, as he
did so, the heavy leaves which seemed to be overshadowing
its last days of life.</p>

<p>The girl pushed him aside impetuously, and plucking
the faded flower deliberately thrust it into her mouth.</p>

<p>“I love eating them,” she cried, “I used to do it
when I was ever so little and I do it still when I am
alone. You’ve no idea how nice they taste!”</p>

<p>At that moment they heard the sound of the church
clock striking six.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried Gladys. “Mr. Clavering will be
waiting. He’ll be cross if I’m too dreadfully late.”</p>

<p>They emerged from the wood and followed the
grass-grown lane, round by the small mill-pond.
Crossing the park once more, they entered the village
by the Yeoborough road.</p>

<p>“What a girl!” said Dangelis to himself, in a voice
of unmitigated admiration, as he held open for her,
at last, the little gate of the old vicarage garden,
and waved his good-bye.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>“What a girl! Heaven help that unfortunate Mr.
Clavering! If he’s as susceptible as most of these
young Englishmen, she’ll make havoc of his poor
heart. Will he read the ‘Imitation’ with her, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>He strolled slowly back, the way they had come,
the personality of the insidious Gladys pressing less
and less heavily upon him as his thought reverted
to his painting. He resolved that he would throw all
these recent impressions together in some large and
sumptuous picture, that should give to these modern
human figures something of the ample suggestion and
noble aplomb, the secret of which seemed to have
been lost to the world with the old Flemish and
Venetian masters.</p>

<p>What in his soul he vaguely imaged as his task,
was an attempt to eliminate all mystic and symbolic
attitudes from his works, and to catch, in their place,
if the inspiration came to him, something of the
lavish prodigality, superbly material, and yet possessed
of ineffable vistas, of the large careless evocations
of nature herself.</p>

<p>His imaginative purpose, as it defined itself more
and more clearly in his mind, during his solitary
return through the evening light, seemed to imply an
attempted reproduction of those aspects of the human
drama, in such a place as this, which carried upon
their surface the air of things that could not happen
otherwise, and which, in their large inevitableness,
over-brimmed and over-flowed all traditional distinctions.
He would have liked to have given, in
this way, to the figures of Gladys and her mother,
something of the superb non-moral “insouciance,”
springing, like the movements of animals and the
fragrance of plants, out of the bosom of an earth
innocent of both introspection and renunciation, which
one observes in the forms of Attic sculpture, or in
the creations of Venetian colourists. Below the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
ornamental wall of Nevilton garden he paused a
moment before entering the little postern-gate, to
admire the indescribable greenness and luxuriousness
of the heavy grass devoted in this place, not to hay-makers
but to cattle. There was a sort of poetry,
he humorously told himself, even about the great
black heaps of cow-dung which alternated here with
the golden clumps of drowsy buttercups. They also,&mdash;why
not?&mdash;might be brought into the kind of
picture he visioned, just as Veronese brought his
mongrels and curs to the very feet of the Saviour!</p>

<p>Dangelis lifted his eyes, to where, through a gap in
the leafy uplands, the more distant hills were visible.
He could make out clearly, in the rich purple light,
the long curving lines of the Corton downs, as they
melted, little by little, in a floating lake of aerial
blue-grey vapour, the exhalation of the great valley’s
day-long breathing.</p>

<p>He could even mark, at the end of the Corton
range&mdash;and the sight of it gave him a thrilling
sense of the invincible continuity of life in these
regions&mdash;the famous tree-crested circle of Cadbury
Camp, the authentic site of the Arthurian Camelot.</p>

<p>What a lodging this Nevilton was, to pass one’s
days in, to work in, and to love and dream! What
enchantments were all around him! What memories!
What dumb voices!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MYTHOLOGY OF SACRIFICE</span></h2>

<p>June, in Nevilton, that summer, seemed debarred
by some strange interdiction from regaining its
normal dampness and rainy discomfort.</p>

<p>It continued unnaturally hot and dry&mdash;so dry, that
though the hay-harvest was still in full session, the
farmers were growing seriously anxious and impatient
for the long-delayed showers. It had been, as we
have already noted, an unusual season. Not only
were there so many blue-bells lingering in the shadowy
places in the woods, but among the later flowers there
were curious over-lappings.</p>

<p>The little milk-wort blossoms, for instance, on Leo’s
Hill, were overtaken, before they perished, by premature
out-croppings of yellow trefoil and purple thyme.</p>

<p>The walnut-trees had still something left of their
spring freshness, while in the hedges along the roads,
covered, all of them, with a soft coating of thin
white dust, the wild-roses and the feathery grasses
suggested the heart of the year’s prime.</p>

<p>It was about eight o’clock, in the evening of a day
towards the end of the second week in this unusual
month, that Mr. Hugh Clavering emerged from the
entrance of the Old Vicarage with a concentrated
and brooding expression. His heart was indeed rent
and torn within him by opposite and contrary emotions.
With one portion of his sensitive nature he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
was craving desperately for the next day’s interview
with Gladys; with the other portion he was making
firm and drastic resolutions to avoid it and escape
from it. She was due to come to his house in the
afternoon&mdash;less than twenty-four hours’ time from
this actual moment! But the more rigorous half of
his being had formed the austere plan of sending her
a note in the morning begging her to appear, along
with the other candidates, at a later hour. He had
written the note and it still remained, propped up
against the little Arundel print of the Transfiguration,
on the mantelpiece of his room.</p>

<p>He went up the street with bowed, absorbed head,
hardly noticing the salutations of the easy loiterers
gathered outside the door of the Goat and Boy,&mdash;the
one of Nevilton’s two taverns which just at
present attracted the most custom. Passing between
the tavern and the churchyard wall, he pushed open
the gate leading into the priory farm-yard, and
striding hurriedly through it began the ascent of
the grassy slope at the base of Nevilton Mount.</p>

<p>The wind had sunk with the sinking of the sun, and
an immense quietness lay like a catafalque of sacred
interposition on the fields and roofs and orchards of
the valley. A delicious smell of new-mown grass
blent itself with the heavy perfume of the great white
blossoms of the elder bushes&mdash;held out, like so many
consecrated chalices to catch the last drops of soft-lingering
light, before it faded away.</p>

<p>Hugh Clavering went over the impending situation
again and again; first from one point of view, then
from another. The devil whispered to him&mdash;if it
were the devil&mdash;that he had no right to sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
his spiritual influence over this disconcerting pupil,
out of a mere personal embarrassment. If he gave
her her lesson along with the rest, all that special
effort he had bestowed upon her thought, her reading,
her understanding, might so easily be thrown away!
She was different, obviously different, from the simple
village maids, and to put her now, at this late hour,
with the confirmation only a few weeks off, into the
common class, would be to undo the work of several
months. He could not alter his method with the
others for her sake, and she would be forced to listen
to teaching which to her would be elementary and
platitudinous. He would be throwing her back in her
spiritual development. He would be forcing her to return
to the mere alphabet of theology at the moment
when she had just begun to grow interested in its
subtle and beautiful literature. She would no doubt
be both bored and teased. Her nerves would be
ruffled, her interest diminished, her curiosity dulled.
She would be angry, too, at being treated exactly as
were these rustic maidens&mdash;and anger was not a
desirable attribute in a gentle catechumen.</p>

<p>Besides, her case was different from theirs on quite
technical grounds. She was preparing for baptism as
well as confirmation, and he, as her priest, was
bound to make this, the most essential of all Christian
sacraments, the head and front of his instruction.
It was hardly to the point to say that the other girls
knew quite as little of the importance of this sacred
rite as she did. His explanations of it to them, his
emphasis upon the blessing it had already been to
them, would be necessarily too simple and childish
for her quicker, maturer understanding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>As he reached the actual beginning of the woody
eminence and turned for a moment to inhale the
magical softness of the invading twilight, it occurred
to him that from a logically ecclesiastical standpoint
it was a monstrous thing that he should be serenely
and coldly debating the cutting off of his spiritual
assistance from this poor thirsty flower of the heathen
desert. She was unbaptized&mdash;and to be unbaptized,
according to true doctrine, meant, with all our
Christian opportunities, a definite peril, a grave and
assured peril, to her immortal soul. Who was he
that he should play with such a formidable risk&mdash;such
a risk to such a lamb of the Great Shepherd?
It was quite probable&mdash;he knew it was probable&mdash;that,
angry with him for deserting her so causelessly
and unreasonably, she would refuse to go further in
the sacred business. She would say, and say justly,
that since the affair seemed of so little importance to
him she would make it of little importance to herself.
Suppose he were to call in some colleague from
Yeoborough, and make over this too exciting
neophyte to some other pastor of souls&mdash;would she
agree to such a casual transference? He knew well
enough that she would not.</p>

<p>How unfortunate it was that the peculiar constitution
of his English Church made these things so
difficult! The individual personality of the priest
mattered so much in Anglican circles! The nobler
self in him envied bitterly at that moment the stricter
and yet more malleable organization of the Mother
Church. How easy it would be were he a Roman
priest. A word to his superior in office, and all
would arrange itself! It was impossible to imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
himself speaking such a word to the Right Reverend
the Bishop of Glastonbury. The mere idea of such
a thing, in our England of discreet propriety, made
him smile in the midst of his distress.</p>

<p>The thought of the Roman Church brought into
his mind the plausible figure of Mr. Taxater. How
that profound and subtle humanist would chuckle
over his present dilemma! He would probably
regard it as a proper and ironical punishment upon
him for his heretical assumption of this traditional
office.</p>

<p>Tradition! That was the thing. Tradition and
organization. After all, it was only to Hugh Clavering,
as a nameless impersonal priest of God, that
this lovely outcast lamb came begging to be enfolded.
He had no right to dally with the question at all.
There <em>was</em> no question. As the priest of Nevilton it
was his clear pastoral duty to give every possible
spiritual assistance to every person in his flock. What
if the pursuit of this duty did throw temptation&mdash;intolerable
temptation&mdash;in his way? His business was
not to try and escape from such a struggle; but to face
it, to wrestle with it, to overcome it! He was like a
sentinel at his post in a great war. Was he to leave
his post and retreat to the rear because the shells
were bursting so thickly round him?</p>

<p>He sat down on the grass with his back to an
ancient thorn-tree and gazed upon the tower of his
beloved church. Would he not be false to that
Church&mdash;false to his vows of ordination&mdash;if he were
now to draw back from the firing-line of the battle
and give up the struggle by a cowardly retreat?
Even supposing the temptation were more than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
could endure&mdash;even supposing that he fell&mdash;would
not God prefer his suffering such a fall with his face
to the foe, sword in hand, rather than that he should
be saved, his consecrated weapon dropped from his
fingers, in squalid ignoble flight?</p>

<p>So much for the arguments whispered in his ear
by the angel of darkness! But he had lately been
visited by another angel&mdash;surely not of darkness&mdash;and
he recalled the plausible reasonings of the great
champion of the papacy, as he sat in that pleasant
window sipping his wine. Why should he agitate
himself so furiously over this little matter? After
all, why not enjoy the pleasure of this exquisite being’s
society? He was in no danger of doing her any harm&mdash;he
knew Gladys at least well enough by now to
know that!&mdash;and what harm could she do him?
There was no harm in being attracted irresistibly to
something so surpassingly attractive! Suppose he
fell really in love with her? Well! There was no
religious rule&mdash;certainly none in the church he
belonged to&mdash;against falling in love with a lovable
and desirable girl. But it was not a matter of falling
in love. He knew that well enough. There was
very little of the romantic or the sentimental about
the feelings she aroused in him. It was just a simple,
sensuous, amorous attraction to a provocative and
alluring daughter of Eve. Just a simple sensuous
attraction&mdash;so simple, so natural, as to be almost
“innocent,” as Mr. Taxater would put it.</p>

<p>So he argued with himself; but the Tower of the
Church opposite seemed to invade the mists of these
subtle reasonings with a stern emphasis of clear-cut
protest. He knew well enough that his peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
nature was not of the kind that might be called
“sensuous” or “amorous,” but of quite a different
sort. The feelings that had lately been excited in
him were as concentrated and passionate as his
feelings for the altar he served. They were indeed
a sort of temporal inversion of this sacred ardour;
or, as the cynical Mr. Quincunx in his blunt manner
would have expressed it, this sacred fire itself was
only a form taken by the more earthly flame. But
a “flame” it was,&mdash;not any gentle toying with soft
sensation,&mdash;a flame, a madness, a vice, an obsession.</p>

<p>In no ideal sense could he be said to be “in love”
with Gladys. He was intoxicated with her. His
senses craved for her as they might have craved for
some sort of maddening drug. In his heart of hearts
he knew well that the emotion he felt was closely
allied to a curious kind of antagonism. He thought
of her with little tenderness, with no gentle, responsible
consideration. Her warm insidious charm maddened
and perturbed him. It did not diffuse itself
through his senses like a tender fragrance. It provoked,
disturbed, and tantalized. She was no Rose
of Sharon, to be worshipped forever. She was a Rose
of Shiraz, to be seized, pressed against his face, and
flung aside! The appeal she made to him was an
appeal to what was perverse, vicious, dangerous
devastating, in his nature. To call his attraction to
her beauty “innocent”&mdash;in Mr. Taxater’s phrase&mdash;was
a mere hypercritical white-washing of the brutal
fact.</p>

<p>His mind, in its whirling agitation, conjured up the
image of himself as married to her, as legally and
absolutely possessed of her. The image was like fuel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
his flame, but it brought no solution of the problem.
Marriage, though permitted by his church, was as
directly contrary to his own interpretation of his duty
as a priest, as any mortal sin might be. To him it
would have been a mortal sin&mdash;the betrayal of his
profoundest ideal. In the perversity&mdash;if you will&mdash;of
his ecclesiastical conscience, he felt towards such a
solution the feeling a man might have if the selling
of his soul were to be a thing transacted in cold
blood, rather than in the tempest of the moment.
To marry Gladys would be to summon the very
sacraments of his church to bless with a blasphemous
consecration his treachery to their appeal.</p>

<p>Rent and torn by all these conflicting thoughts, the
poor clergyman scrambled once more to his feet,
pushed his way recklessly through the intervening
fence, and began ascending the steep side of the
pyramidal hill. As he struggled upward, through
burdocks, nettles, tall grasses, red-campion, and
newly planted firs, his soul felt within him as if it
were something fleeing from an invincible pursuer.
The rank aromatic smell of torn elder-boughs and
the pungent odour of trodden ground-ivy filled his nostrils.
His clothes were sprinkled with feathery seed-dust.
Closely-sticking burs clung to his legs and arms.
Outstretched branches switched his face with their
leaves. His feet stumbled over young fern-fronds,
bent earthwards in their elaborate unsheathing.</p>

<p>He vaguely associated with his thoughts, as he
struggled on, certain queer purple markings which
he noticed on the stalks of the thickly-grown hemlocks,
and the bind-weed, which entwined itself round
many of the slenderer tree-stems, became a symbol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the power that assailed him. To escape&mdash;to be
free! This was the burden of his soul’s crying as he
plunged forward through all these dim leafy obstructions.</p>

<p>Gradually, as he drew nearer the hill’s summit,
there formed in his mind the only real sanctuary of
refuge, the only genuine deliverance. He must obey
his innate conscience; and let the result be as God
willed. At all costs he must shake himself clear of
this hot, sweet, luscious bind-weed, that was choking
the growth of his soul. His own soul&mdash;that, after
all, was his first care, his predominant concern. To
keep <em>that</em>, pure and undefiled, and let all else go!
Confused by the subtle arguments of the serpent, he
would cling only the more passionately to the actual
figure of the God-Man, and obey his profound command
in its literal simplicity. Ecclesiastical casuistry
might say what it pleased about the danger he
plunged Gladys into, in thus neglecting her. The
matter had gone deeper than casuistry, deeper, far
deeper, than points of doctrine. It had become a
direct personal struggle between his own soul and
Satan; a struggle in which, as he well knew, the
only victory lay in flight. On other fields he might
be commanded by his celestial Captain to hold his
post to the last; but in the arena of this temptation,
to hold the field was to desert the field; to escape
from it, to win it.</p>

<p>He paused breathlessly under a clump of larches,
and stretching out his arms, seized&mdash;like Samson
in the temple of Dagon&mdash;two of the slender-growing
trunks. “Let all this insidious growth of Nature,”
he thought, “all this teeming and prolific exuberance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of godless life, be thrust into oblivion, as long as the
great translunar Secret be kept inviolable!” Exhausted
by the struggle within him he sank down in
the green twilight of that leafy security, and crossed
his hands over his knees. Through a gap in the foliage
he could perceive the valley below; he could even
perceive the outline of the roof of Nevilton House.
But against the magic of those carved pinnacles he
had found a counter-charm. In the hushed stillness
about him, he seemed conscious of the power of all
these entangled growing things as a sinister heathen
influence pulling him earthward.</p>

<p>Men differ curiously from one another in this
respect. To some among them the influences of
what we call Nature are in harmony with all that
is good in them, and have a soothing and mystical
effect. Others seem to disentangle themselves from
every natural surrounding, and to stand out, against
the background of their own spiritual horizons, clear-edged,
opaque, and resistant.</p>

<p>Clavering was entirely of this latter type. Nature
to him was always full of hidden dangers and secret
perils. He found her power a magical, not a mystical,
one. He resented the spell she cast over him. It
seemed to lend itself, all too willingly, to the vicious
demons that delighted to waylay his unguarded hours.
His instinctive attitude to these enchanting natural
forces was that of a mediæval monk. Their bewitching
shapes, their lovely colours, their penetrating
odours, were all permeated for him by a subtle diffusion
of something evil there; something capable of
leading one’s spirit desperately, miserably far&mdash;if one
allowed it the smallest welcome. Against all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
siren-voices rumouring and whispering so treacherously
around us, against all this shifting and flitting
wizardry, one defence alone availed;&mdash;the clear-cut,
absolute authority, of Him who makes the clouds his
chariot and the earth his footstool.</p>

<p>As Clavering sat crouching there under his tent of
larches, the spirit of the Christ he served seemed to
pass surging through him like a passionate flood. He
drew deep breaths of exquisite relief and comfort.
The problem was solved,&mdash;was indeed no problem
at all; for he had nothing to do but to obey the
absolute authority, the soul-piercing word. Who was
he to question results? The same God who commanded
him to flee from temptation was able&mdash;beyond
the mystery of his own divine method&mdash;to
save her who tempted him, whether baptized or
unbaptized!</p>

<p>He leapt to his feet, and no more like one pursued,
but rather like one pursuing, pushed his way to the
summit of the Mount. The space at the top was
flat and circular; not unlike, in its smooth level
surface, the top of the mountain in that very Transfiguration
picture which was now overshadowing his
letter to his enchantress. In the centre of this open
space rose the thin Thyrsus-shaped tower. He
advanced to the eastern edge of the hill and looked
down over the wide-spread landscape.</p>

<p>The flat elm-fringed meadows of the great mid-Somerset
plain stretched softly away, till they lost
themselves in a purple mist. Never had the formidable
outline of the Leonian promontory looked more
emphatic and sinister than it looked in this deepening
twilight. The sky above it was of a pale green tint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
flecked here and there by feathery streaks of carmine.
The whole sky-dome was still lit by the pallid reflection
of the dead sunset; and on the far northern
horizon, where the Mendip hills rise above the plain,
a livid whitish glimmer touched the rim of an enormous
range of sombre clouds.</p>

<p>The priest stood, hushed, and motionless as a statue,
contemplating this suggestive panorama. But little
of its transparent beauty passed the surface of his
consciousness. He was absorbed, rapt, intent. But
the cause of his abstraction was not the diaphanous
air-spaces above him or the dark earth beneath him;
it was the pouring of the waves of divine love through
his inmost being; it was his fusion with that great
Spirit of the Beyond which renders its votaries independent
of space and time.</p>

<p>After long exquisite moments of this high exultation,
his mind gradually resumed its normal functioning.
A cynical interpreter of this sublime experience
would doubtless have attributed the whole phenomenon
to a natural reaction of the priest, back to his
habitual moral temper, from the turbulent perturbations
of the recent days. Would such a one have
found it a mere coincidence that at the moment of
regaining his natural vision the clergyman’s attention
was arrested by the slow passage of a huge white
cloud towards the Leonian promontory, a cloud that
assumed, as it moved, gigantic and almost human
lineaments?</p>

<p>Coincidence or not, Clavering’s attention was not
allowed to remain fixed upon this interesting spectacle.
It seemed as though his return to ordinary human
consciousness was destined to be attended by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
reappearance of ordinary humanity. He perceived in
the great sloping field on the eastern side of the mount
the white figure of a woman, walking alone. For the
moment his heart stood still; but a second glance
reassured him. He knew that figure, even in the
dying light. It was little Vennie Seldom. Simultaneously
with this discovery he was suddenly aware
that he was no longer the only frequenter of the
woody solitudes of Nevilton Hill. On a sort of
terrace, about a hundred yards below him, there
suddenly moved into sight a boy and a girl, walking
closely interlinked and whispering softly. Acting
mechanically, and as if impelled by an impulse from
an external power, he sank down upon his knees and
spied upon them. They too slipped into a semi-recumbent
posture, apparently upon the branches of
a fallen tree, and proceeded, in blissful unconsciousness
of any spectator, to indulge in a long and passionate
embrace. From where he crouched Clavering
could actually discern these innocents’ kisses, and
catch the little pathetic murmurings of their amorous
happiness. His heart beat wildly and strangely. In
his fingers he clutched great handfuls of earth. His
thoughts played him satyrish and fantastic tricks.
Suddenly he leapt to his feet and stumbled away, like
an animal that has been wounded. He encountered
the Thyrsus-shaped tower&mdash;that queer fancy of
eighteenth century leisure&mdash;and beat with his hands
upon its hard smooth surface. After a second or
two, however, he recovered his self-control; and to
afford some excuse to his own mind for his mad
behaviour, he walked deliberately round the edifice,
looking for its entrance. This he presently found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and stood observing it, with scowling interest, in the
growing darkness. He had recognized the lovers
down there. They were both youngsters of his
parish. He made a detached mental resolve to talk
tomorrow to the girl’s mother. These flirtations
during the hay-harvest often led to trouble.</p>

<p>There was just enough light left for him to remark
some obscure lettering above the little locked door of
this fanciful erection. It annoyed him that he could
not read it. With trembling hand he fumbled in his
pocket&mdash;produced a match-box and lit a match.
There was no difficulty now in reading what it had
been the humour of some eighteenth century Seldom
to have carved on this site of the discovery of the
Holy Rood. “Carpe Diem” he spelt out, before the
flutterings of an agitated moth extinguished the light
he held. This then was the oracle he had climbed
the sacred Mount to hear!</p>

<p>With quick steps, steps over which his mind seemed
no longer to have control, he returned to his point of
observation. The boy and girl had disappeared, but
Vennie Seldom was still visible in her white dress,
pacing up and down the meadow. What was she
doing there?&mdash;he wondered. Did she often slip away,
after the little formal dinner with her mother, and
wander at large through the evening shadows? An
unaccountable rage against her besieged his heart.
He felt he should soon begin to hate her if he watched
her much longer; so, with a more collected and calm
step and a sigh that rose from the depths of his soul
he moved away to where the path descended.</p>

<p>As it happened, however, the path he had to follow
now, for it was too dark to return as he had come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
emerged, after many windings round the circle of the
hill, precisely into the very field, in which Vennie was
walking. He moved straight towards her. She gave
a little start when she saw him, but waited passively,
in that patient drooping pose so natural to her, till
he was by her side.</p>

<p>“You too,” she said, touching his hand, “feel the
necessity of being alone a little while before the day
ends. I always do. Mother sometimes protests.
But it is no good. There are certain little pleasures
that we have a right to enjoy&mdash;haven’t we?”</p>

<p>They moved together along the base of the hill
following its circuit in the northerly direction.
Clavering felt as though, after a backward plunge
into the Inferno, he had encountered a reproachful
angel of light. He half expected her to say to him,
in the crushing austerity of Beatrice, “Lift up your
chin and answer me face to face.” The gentle power
of her pure spirit over him was so persuasive that in
the after-ebb of this second turbulent reaction he
could not refrain from striking the confessional
note.</p>

<p>“I wish I were as good as you, Miss Seldom,” he
said. “I fear the power of evil in me goes beyond
anything you could possibly conceive.”</p>

<p>“There are few things I cannot conceive, Mr.
Clavering,” the girl answered, with that helpless droop
of her little head that had so winning a pathos.
“We people who live such secluded lives are not as
ignorant of the great storms as you may imagine.”</p>

<p>Clavering’s voice shook as he responded to this.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<p>“I wish I could talk quite freely to you. This
convention that forbids friends such as we are from
being frank with one another, seems to me sometimes
an invention of the devil.”</p>

<p>The girl lifted her head. He could not see in the
darkness that had now fallen upon them, how her
mouth quivered and her cheeks grew scarlet.</p>

<p>“I think I can guess at what is worrying you, my
friend,” she murmured gently.</p>

<p>He trembled from head to foot with a curious shame.
“You think it is about Gladys Romer,” he burst
out. “Well it is! I find her one of the greatest
difficulties I have ever had in my life.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” said Vennie timidly, “she intends
to be a difficulty to you. It is wrong to say so, but
I have always been suspicious of her motives in this
desire to enter our church.”</p>

<p>“God knows what her motives are!” sighed the
priest, “I only know she makes it as hard for me as
she can.”</p>

<p>As soon as he had uttered these words a queer
observing sense of having been treacherous to Gladys
rose in his heart. Once more he had to suppress an
emotion of hatred for the little saint by his side.</p>

<p>“I know,” murmured Vennie, “I know. She tries
to play upon your good-nature. She tries to make
you over-fond of her. I suppose”&mdash;she paused for
a moment&mdash;“I suppose she is like that. It is not
her fault. It is her&mdash;her character. She has a mad
craving for admiration and is ready to play it off on
anybody.”</p>

<p>“It makes it very difficult to help her,” said the
priest evasively.</p>

<p>Vennie peered anxiously at his face. “It is not as
though she really was fond of <em>you</em>,” she boldly added.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
“I doubt whether she is fond of anyone. She loves
troubling people’s minds and making them unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mistake me, Miss Seldom,” cried Clavering.
“I am not in the least sentimental about her&mdash;it is
only&mdash;only”&mdash;Vennie smoothed his path for him.</p>

<p>“It is only that she makes it impossible for you to
teach her,” she hazarded, following his lead. “I
know something of that difficulty myself. These
wayward pleasure-loving people make it very hard
for us all sometimes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clavering shook his stick defiantly into the
darkness, whether as a movement directed against
the powers of evil or against the powers of good, he
would himself have found it hard to say. Queer
thoughts of a humourous frivolity passed through his
mind. Something in the girl’s grave tone had an
irritating effect upon him. It is always a little annoying,
even to the best of men, to feel themselves being
guided and directed by women, unless they are in
love with them. Clavering was certainly not in love
with Vennie; and though in his emotional agitation
he had gone so far in confiding in her, he was by no
means unconscious of something incongruous and even
ridiculous in the situation. This queer new frivolity
in him, which now peered forth from some twisted
corner of his nature, like a rat out of a hole, found
this whole interview intolerably absurd. He suddenly
experienced the sensation of being led along at
Vennie’s side like a convicted school-boy. He found
himself rebelling against all women in his heart,
both good and bad, and recalling, humorously and
sadly, the old sweet scandalous attitude of contempt
for the whole sex, of his irresponsible Cambridge days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Perhaps, dimly and unconsciously, he was reacting
now, after all this interval, to the subtle influence of
Mr. Taxater. He knew perfectly well that the very
idea of a man&mdash;not to speak of a priest&mdash;confiding
his amorous weaknesses to a woman, would have
excited that epicurean sage to voluble fury. Everything
that was mediæval and monkish in him rose up
too, in support of this interior outburst of Rabelaisean
spleen.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know if Vennie had any
inkling, as she walked in the darkness by his side,
of this new and unexpected veering of his mood.
Certainly she refrained from pressing him for any
further confessions. Perhaps with the genuine clairvoyance
of a saint she was conscious of her danger.
At any rate she began speaking to him of herself,
of her difficulties with her mother and her mother’s
friends, of her desire to be of more use to Lacrima
Traffio, and of the obstacles in the way of that.</p>

<p>Conversing with friendly familiarity on these less
poignant topics they arrived at last at the gates of
the Priory farm and the entrance to the church.
Mr. Clavering was proceeding to escort her home,
when she suddenly stopped in the road, and said in a
quick hurried whisper, “I should dearly love to walk
once round the churchyard before I go back.”</p>

<p>The cheerful light from the windows of the Goat
and Boy showed, as it shone upon his face, his
surprise as well as his disinclination. The truth is,
that by a subtle reversion of logic he had now reached
the idea that it was at once absurd and unkind to
send that letter to Gladys. He was trembling to
tear it in pieces, and burn the pieces in his kitchen-fire!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Vennie however, did not look at his face. She
looked at the solemn tower of St. Catharine’s
church.</p>

<p>“Please get the key,” she said, “and let us walk
once round.”</p>

<p>He was compelled to obey her, and knocking at
the door of the clerk’s cottage aroused that astonished
and scandalized official into throwing the object
required out of his bedroom window. Once inside the
churchyard however, the strange and mystical power
of the spot brought his mood into nearer conformity
with his companion’s.</p>

<p>They stopped, as everyone who visits Nevilton
churchyard is induced to stop, before the extraordinary
tomb of Gideon and Naomi Andersen. The
thing had been constructed from the eccentric old
carver’s own design, and had proved one of the
keenest pleasures of his last hours.</p>

<p>Like the whimsical poet Donne, he had derived a
sardonic and not altogether holy delight in contemplating
before his end the actual slab of earthly consistence
that was to make his bodily resurrection so emphatically
miraculous. Clavering and Vennie stood for several
minutes in mute contemplation before this strange
monument. It was composed of a huge, solid block of
Leonian stone, carved at the top into the likeness of an
enormous human skull, and ornamented, below the
skull, by a deeply cut cross surrounded by a circle.
This last addition gave to the sacred symbol within
it a certain heathen and ungodly look, making it
seem as though it were no cross at all, but a pagan
hieroglyph from some remote unconsecrated antiquity.
The girl laid her fragile hand on the monstrous image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of death, which the gloom around them made all the
more threatening.</p>

<p>“It is wonderful,” she said, “how the power of
Christ can change even the darkest objects into
beauty. I like to think of Him striking His hand
straight through the clumsy half-laws of Man and
Nature, and holding out to us the promise of things
far beyond all this morbid dissolution.”</p>

<p>“You are right, my friend,” answered the priest.</p>

<p>“I think the world is really a dark and dreadful
place,” she went on. “I cannot help saying so. I
know there are people who only see its beauty and
joy. I cannot feel like that. If it wasn’t for Him
I should be utterly miserable. I think I should go
mad. There is too much unhappiness&mdash;too much to
be borne! But this strong hand of His, struck clean
down to us from outside the whole wretched confusion,&mdash;I
cling to that; and it saves me. I know
there are lots of happy people, but I cannot forget
the others! I think of them in the night. I think
of them always. They are so many&mdash;so many!”</p>

<p>“Dear child!” murmured the priest, his interlude
of casual frivolity melting away like mist under the
flame of her conviction.</p>

<p>“Do you think,” she continued, “that if we were
able to hear the weeping of all those who suffer and
have suffered since the beginning of the world, we
could endure the idea of going on living? It would be
too much! The burden of those tears would darken
the sun and hide the moon. It is only His presence
in the midst of us,&mdash;His presence, coming in from
outside, that makes it possible for us to endure and
have patience.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, He must come in from <em>outside</em>,” murmured
the priest, “or He cannot help us. He must be able
to break every law and custom and rule of nature
and man. He must strike at the whole miserable
entanglement from outside it&mdash;from outside it!”</p>

<p>Clavering’s voice rose almost to a shout as he uttered
these last words. He felt as though he were refuting
in one tremendous cry of passionate certainty all those
“modernistic” theories with which he loved sometimes
to play. He was completely under Vennie’s
influence now.</p>

<p>“And we must help Him,” said the girl, “by
entering into His Sacrifice. Only by sacrifice&mdash;by
the sacrifice of everything&mdash;can we enable Him to
work the miracle which He would accomplish!”</p>

<p>Clavering could do nothing but echo her words.</p>

<p>“The sacrifice of everything,” he whispered, and
abstractedly laid <em>his</em> hand upon the image of death
carved by the old artist. Moved apparently by an
unexpected impulse, Vennie seized, with her own, the
hand thus extended.</p>

<p>“I have thought,” she cried, “of a way out of your
difficulty. Give her her lessons in the church! That
will not hurt her feelings, and it will save you. It
will prevent her from distracting your mind, and
it will concentrate her attention upon your teaching.
It will save you both!”</p>

<p>Clavering held the little hand, thus innocently
given him, tenderly and solemnly in both of his.</p>

<p>“You are right, my friend,” he said, and then,
gravely and emphatically as if repeating a vow,&mdash;“I
will take her in the church. That will settle
everything.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Vennie seemed thrilled with spiritual joy at his
acquiescence in her happy inspiration. She walked
so rapidly as they recrossed the churchyard that he
could hardly keep pace with her. She seemed to
long to escape, to the solitude of her own home, of
her own room, in order to give full vent to her
feelings. He locked the gate of the porch behind
them, and put the key in his pocket. Very quickly
and in complete silence they made their way up the
road to the entrance of the Vicarage garden.</p>

<p>Here they separated, with one more significant and
solemn hand-clasp. It was as if the spirit of St.
Catharine herself was in the girl, so ethereal did she
look, so transported by unearthly emotion, as the
gate swung behind her.</p>

<p>As for the vicar of Nevilton, he strode back impetuously
to his own house, and there, from its place
beneath the print of the transfiguration, he took the
letter, and tore it into many pieces; but he tore it
with a different intention from that which, an hour
before, had ruled his brain; and the sleep which
awaited him, as soon as his head touched his pillow,
was the soundest and sweetest he had known since
first he came to the village.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MYTHOLOGY OF POWER</span></h2>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of the day following
the events just described. Mrs. Fringe was
passing in and out of Clavering’s sitting-room
making the removal of his tea an opportunity for
interminable discourse.</p>

<p>“They say Eliza Wotnot’s had a bad week of it
with one thing and another. They say she be as
yellow as a lemon-pip in her body, as you might call
it, and grey as ash-heaps in her old face. I never
cared for the woman myself, and I don’t gather as
she was desperate liked in the village, but a Christian’s
a Christian when they be laid low in the
Lord’s pleasure, though they be as surly-tongued as
Satan.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” said the clergyman impatiently.</p>

<p>“They say Mr. Taxater sits up with her night after
night as if he was a trained nurse. Why he don’t
have a nurse I can’t think, ’cept it be some papist
practice. The poor gentleman will be getting woeful
thin, if this goes on. He’s not one for losing his sleep
and his regular meals.”</p>

<p>“Sally Birch is doing all that for him, Mrs. Fringe,”
said Clavering. “I have seen to it myself.”</p>

<p>“Sally Birch knows as much about cooking a
gentleman’s meals as my Lottie, and that’s not saying
a great deal.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Fringe, thank you,” said Clavering.
“You need not move the table.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, ’tis Miss Gladys’ lesson-day. They
say she’s given young Mr. Ilminster the go-by, sir.
’Tis strange and wonderful how some people be made
by the holy Lord to have their whole blessed pleasure
in this world. Providence do love the ones as loves
themselves, and those that seeks what they want shall
find it! I expect, between ourselves, sir, the young
lady have got someone else in her eye. They tell me
some great thundering swell from London is staying
in the House.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Mrs. Fringe, that’ll do. You can
leave those flowers a little longer.”</p>

<p>“I ought to let you know, sir, that old Jimmy
Pringle has gone off wandering again. I saw Witch-Bessie
at his door when I went to the shop this
morning and she told me he was talking and talking,
as badly as ever he did. Far gone, poor old sinner,
Witch-Bessie said he was.”</p>

<p>“He is a religious minded man, I believe, at bottom,”
said the clergyman.</p>

<p>“He be stark mad, sir, if that’s what you mean! As
to the rest, they say his carryings on with that harlotry
down in Yeoborough was a disgrace to a Christian
country.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Clavering, “I know, but we all
have our temptations, Mrs. Fringe.”</p>

<p>“Temptations, sir?” and the sandy complexioned
female snorted with contempt. “And is those as
takes no drop of liquor, and looks at no man edge-ways,
though their own lawful partner be a stiff
corpse of seven years’ burying, to be put in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
same class with them as goes rampaging with
harlotries?”</p>

<p>“He has repented, Mrs. Fringe, he has repented.
He told me so himself when I met him last week.”</p>

<p>“Repented!” groaned the indignant woman; “he
repents well who repents when he can’t sin no more.
His talk, if you ask me, sir, is more scandalous than
religious. Witch-Bessie told me she heard him say
that he had seen the Lord Himself. I am not a
learned scholar like you, sir, but I know this, that
when the Lord does go about the earth he doesn’t
visit hoary old villains like Jimmy Pringle&mdash;except
to tell them they be damned.”</p>

<p>“Did he really say that?” asked the clergyman,
feeling a growing interest in Mr. Pringle’s revelations.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he did, sir! Said he met God,&mdash;those
were his very words, and indecent enough words I
call them!&mdash;out along by Captain Whiffley’s drive-gate.
You should have heard Witch-Bessie tell me.
He frightened her, he did, the wicked old man!
God, he said, came to him, as I might come to you,
sir, quite ordinary and familiar-like. ‘Jimmy,’ said
God, all sudden, as if he were a person passing the
time of day, ‘I have come to see you, Jimmy.’</p>

<p>“‘And who may you be, Mister?’ said the wicked
old man, just as though the Lord above were a casual
decent-dressed gentleman.</p>

<p>“‘I am God, Jimmy,’ said the Vision. ‘And I be
come to tell ’ee how dearly I loves ’ee, spite of Satan
and all his works.’ Witch-Bessie told me,” Mrs.
Fringe continued, “how as the old man said things
to her as she never thought to hear from human lips,
so dreadful they were.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what happened then?” asked Clavering
eagerly.</p>

<p>“What happened then? Why God went away, he
said, in a great cloud of roaring fire, and he was
left alone, all dazed-like. Did you ever hear such a
scimble-scamble story in your life, sir? And all by
Captain Whiffley’s drive-gate!”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Fringe,” said the clergyman, “I think
we must postpone the rest of this interesting conversation
till supper-time. I have several things I want
to do.”</p>

<p>“I know you have, sir, I know you have. It isn’t
easy to find out from all them books ways and means
of keeping young ladies like Miss Gladys in the path
of salvation. How does she get on, sir, if I might
be so bold? I fear she don’t learn her catechism as
quiet and patient as I used to learn mine, under old
Mr. Ravelin, God forgive him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think Miss Romer is quite as good a
pupil as you used to be, Mrs. Fringe,” said Clavering,
rising and gently ushering her out of the
door.</p>

<p>“She’s as good as some of these new-fangled village
hussies, anyway,” retorted the irrepressible lady,
turning on the threshold. “They tell me that Lucy
Vare was off again last night with that rascally Tom
Mooring. She’ll be in trouble, that young girl, before
she wants to be.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” sighed the clergyman sadly,
fumbling with the door handle.</p>

<p>“You don’t know all you <em>ought</em> to know, sir, if
you’ll pardon my boldness,” returned the woman,
making a step backwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know, because I saw them!” shouted Clavering,
closing the door with irritable violence.</p>

<p>“Goodness me!” muttered Mrs. Fringe, returning
to her kitchen, “if the poor young man knew what
this parish was really like, he wouldn’t talk so freely
about ‘seeing’ people!”</p>

<p>Left to himself, Clavering moved uneasily round his
room, taking down first one book and then another,
and looking anxiously at his shelves as if seeking
something from them more efficient than eloquent
words.</p>

<p>“As soon as she comes,” he said to himself, “I
shall take her across to the church.”</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. The door at the end of
the garden-path clicked. Light-tripping steps followed,
and Gladys Romer’s well-known figure made
itself visible through the open window. He hastened
out to meet her, hoping to forestall the hospitable
Mrs. Fringe. In this, however, he was unsuccessful.
His housekeeper was already in the porch, taking
from the girl her parasol and gloves. How these
little things, these chance-thrown little things, always
intervene between our good resolutions and their
accomplishment! He ought to have been ready in his
garden, on the watch for her. Surely he had not intentionally
remained in his room? No, it was the
fault of Mrs. Fringe; of Mrs. Fringe and her stories
about Jimmy Pringle and God. He wished that “a
roaring cloud of fire” would rise between him and
this voluptuous temptress. But probably, priest
though he was, he lacked the faith of that ancient
reprobate. He stood aside to let her enter. The
words “I think it would be better if we went over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to the church,” stuck, unuttered, to the roof of his
mouth. She held out her white ungloved hand, and
then, as soon as the door was closed, began very
deliberately removing her hat.</p>

<p>He stood before her smiling, that rather inept
smile, which indicates the complete paralysis of every
faculty, except the faculty of admiration. He could
hardly now suggest a move to the church. He
could not trouble her to re-assume that charming
hat. Besides, what reason could he give? He did,
however, give a somewhat ambiguous reason for
following out Vennie’s heroic plan on another&mdash;a
different&mdash;occasion. In the tone we use when allaying
the pricks of conscience by tacitly treating that
sacred monitor as if its intelligence were of an inferior
order: “One of these days,” he said, “we must
have our lesson in the church. It would be so nice
and cool there, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>There was a scent of burning weeds in the front-room
of the old Vicarage, when master and neophyte
sat down together, at the round oak table, before the
extended works of Pusey and Newman. Sombre
were the bindings of these repositories of orthodoxy,
but the pleasant afternoon sun streamed wantonly
over them and illumined their gloom.</p>

<p>Gladys had seated herself so that the light fell
caressingly upon her yellow hair and deepened into
exquisite attractiveness the soft shadows of her throat
and neck. Her arms were sleeveless; and as she leaned
them against the table, their whiteness and roundness
were enhanced by the warm glow.</p>

<p>The priest spoke in a low monotonous voice,
explaining doctrines, elucidating mysteries, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
emphasizing moral lessons. He spoke of baptism. He
described the manner in which the Church had appropriated
to her own purpose so many ancient pagan
customs. He showed how the immemorial heathen
usages of “immersion” and “ablution” had become,
in her hands, wonderful and suggestive symbols of
the purifying power of the nobler elements. He used
words that he had come, by frequent repetition, to
know by heart. In order that he might point out
to her passages in his authors which lent themselves
to the subject, he brought his chair round to her
side.</p>

<p>The sound of her gentle breathing, and the terrible
attraction of her whole figure, as she leant
forward, in sweet girlish attention to what he was
saying, maddened the poor priest.</p>

<p>In her secret heart Gladys hardly understood a
single word. The phrase “immersion,” whenever it
occurred, gave her an irresistible desire to laugh. She
could not help thinking of her favourite round pond.
The pond set her thinking of Lacrima and how
amusing it was to frighten her. But this lesson with
the young clergyman was even more amusing. She
felt instinctively that it was upon herself his attention
rested, whatever mysterious words might pass
his lips.</p>

<p>Once, as they were leaning together over the
“Development of Christian Doctrine,” and he was
enlarging upon the gradual evolution of one sacred
implication after another, she let her arm slide lightly
over the back of his hand; and a savage thrill of
triumph rose in her heart, as she felt an answering
magnetic shiver run through his whole frame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“The worship of the Body of our Saviour,” he
said&mdash;using his own words as a shield against her&mdash;“allows
no subterfuges, no reserves. It gathers to
itself, as it sweeps down the ages, every emotion,
every ardour, every passion of man. It appropriates
all that is noble in these things to its own high purpose,
and it makes even of the evil in them a means
to yet more subtle good.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, with an imperceptible gesture of
liberation he rose from his seat by her side and set
himself to pace the room. The struggle he was
making caused his fingers to clench and re-clench
themselves in the palms of his hands, as though he
were squeezing the perfume from handfuls of scented
leaves.</p>

<p>The high-spirited girl knew by instinct the suffering
she was causing, but she did not yield to any
ridiculous pity. She only felt the necessity of holding
him yet more firmly. So she too rose from her chair,
and, slipping softly to the window, seated herself
sideways upon its ledge. Balanced charmingly here&mdash;like
some wood-nymph stolen from the forest to
tease the solitude of some luckless hermit&mdash;she
stretched one arm out of the window, and pulling
towards her a delicate branch of yellow roses, pressed
it against her breast.</p>

<p>The pose of her figure, as she balanced herself
thus, was one of provoking attractiveness, and with
a furtive look of feline patience in her half-shut eyes
she waited while it threw its spell over him.</p>

<p>The scent of burning weeds floated into the room.
Clavering’s thoughts whirled to and fro in his head
like whipped chaff. “I must go on speaking,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
thought; “and I must not look at her. If I look at
her I am lost.” He paced the room like a caged
animal. His soul cried out within him to be liberated
from the body of this death. He thought of
the strange tombstone of Gideon Andersen, and
wished he too were buried under it, and free forever!</p>

<p>“Yet is it not my duty to look at her?” the devil
in his heart whispered. “How can I teach her, how
can I influence her for good, if I do not see the effect
of my words? Is it not an insult to the Master
Himself, and His Divine power, to be thus cowardly
and afraid?”</p>

<p>His steps faltered and he leant against the table.</p>

<p>“Christ,” he found his lips repeating, “is the explanation
of all mysteries. He is the secret root
of all natural impulses in us. All emerge from Him
and all return to Him. He is to us what their ancient
god Pan was to the Greeks. He is in a true sense
our <em>All</em>&mdash;for in him is all we are, all we have, and
all we hope. All our passions are His. Touched by
Him, their true originator, they lose their dross, are
purged of their evil, and give forth sweet-smelling,
sweet-breathing&mdash;yellow roses!”</p>

<p>He had not intended to say “yellow roses.” The
sentence had rounded itself off so, apart from his
conscious will.</p>

<p>The girl gravely indicated that she heard him; and
then smiled dreamily, acquiescingly&mdash;the sort of
smile that yields to a spiritual idea, as if it were a
physical caress.</p>

<p>The scent of burning weeds continued to float in
through the window. “Oh, it has gone!” she cried
suddenly, as, released from her fingers, the branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
swung back to its place against the sandstone
wall.</p>

<p>“I must have it again,” she added, bending her
supple body backwards. She made one or two ineffectual
efforts and then gave up, panting. “I can’t
reach it,” she said. “But go on, Mr. Clavering. I
can listen to you like this. It is so nice out here.”</p>

<p>Strange unfathomable thoughts surged up in the
depths of Clavering’s soul. He found himself wishing
that he had authority over her, that he might tame
her wilful spirit, and lay her under the yoke of some
austere penance. Why was she free to provoke him
thus, with her merciless fragility? The madness she
was arousing grew steadily upon him. He stumbled
awkwardly round the edge of the table and approached
her. The scent of burning weeds became
yet more emphatic. To make his nearness to her
less obvious, and out of a queer mechanical instinct
to allay his own conscience, he continued his spiritual
admonitions, even when he was quite close&mdash;even
when he could have touched her with his hand. And
it would be so easy to touch her! The playful
perilousness of her position in the window made such
a movement natural, justifiable, almost conventional.</p>

<p>“The true doctrine of the Incarnation,” his lips repeated,
“is not that something contrary to nature
has happened; it is that the innermost secret of
Nature has been revealed. And this secret,”&mdash;here
his fingers closed feverishly on the casement-latch&mdash;“is
identical with the force that swings the furthest
star, and drives the sap through the veins of all living
things.”</p>

<p>It would have been of considerable interest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a student of religious psychology&mdash;like Mr. Taxater
for example&mdash;to observe how the phrases that
mechanically passed Clavering’s lips at this juncture
were all phrases drawn from the works of rationalistic
modernists. He had recently been reading the
charming and subtle essays of Father Mervyn; and
the soft and melodious harmonies of that clever
theologian’s thought had accumulated in some hidden
corner of his brain. The authentic religious emotion
in him being superseded by a more powerful impulse,
his mind mechanically reverted to the large, dim
regions of mystical speculation. A certain instinct
in him&mdash;the instinct of his clamorous senses&mdash;made
him careful to blur, confuse, and keep far back, that
lovely and terrible “Power from Outside,” the hem
of Whose garments he had clung to, the night
before. “Christ,” he went on, “is, as it were, the
centre and pivot of the whole universe, and every
revelation granted to us of His nature is a revelation
from the system of things itself. I want you to
understand that our true attitude towards this great
mystery, ought to be the attitude of scientific explorers,
who in searching for hidden causes have
come upon the one, the unique Cause.”</p>

<p>The girl’s only indication that she embraced the
significance of these solemn words was to make a
sudden gliding serpentine movement which brought
her into a position more easy to be retained, and
yet one that made it still more unnatural that he
should refuse her some kind of playful and affectionate
support.</p>

<p>The poor priest’s heart beat tumultuously. He
began to lose all consciousness of everything except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
his propinquity to his provoker. He was aware
with appalling distinctness of the precise texture
of the light frock that she wore. It was of a
soft fawn colour, crossed by wavy lines of a darker
tint. He watched the way these wavy lines followed
the curves of her figure. They began at
her side, and ended where her skirt hung loose
over her little swinging ankles. He wished these
lines had sloped upwards, instead of downwards; then
it would have been so much easier for him to follow
the argument of the “Development of Christian
Doctrine.”</p>

<p>Still that scent of burning weeds! Why must his
neighbours set fire to their rubbish, on this particular
afternoon?</p>

<p>With a fierce mental effort he tried to suppress
the thought that those voluptuous lips only waited
for him to overcome his ridiculous scruples. Why
must she wait like this so pitilessly passive, laying
all the burden of the struggle upon him? If she
would only make a little&mdash;a very little&mdash;movement,
his conscience would be able to recover its
equilibrium, whatever happened. He tried to unmagnetize
her attraction, by visualizing the fact that
under this desirable form&mdash;so near his touch&mdash;lurked
nothing but that bleak, bare, last outline of
mortality, to which all flesh must come. He tried
to see her forehead, her closed eyes, her parted
lips, as they would look if resting in a coffin. Like
his monkish predecessors in the world-old struggle
against Satan, he sought to save himself by clutching
fast to the grinning skull.</p>

<p>All this while his lips went on repeating their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
liturgical formula. “We must learn to look upon the
Redemption, as a natural, not a supernatural fact.
We must learn to see in it the motive-force of the
whole stream of evolution. We must remember that
things <em>are</em> what they have it in them to <em>become</em>.
It is the purpose, the end, which is the true truth&mdash;not
the process or the method. Christ is the end
of all things. He is therefore the beginning of all
things. All things find their meaning, their place,
their explanation, only in relation to Him. He is
the reality of the illusion which we call Nature,
and of the illusion which we call Life. In Him the
universe becomes real and living&mdash;which else were
a mere engine of destruction.” How much longer
he would have continued in this strain&mdash;conquered
yet still resisting&mdash;it were impossible to say. All
these noble words, into the rhythm of which so
much passionate modern thought had been poured,
fell from his lips like sand out of a sieve.</p>

<p>The girl herself interrupted him. With a quick
movement she suddenly jerked herself from her recumbent
position; jumped, without his help, lightly
down upon the floor, and resumed her former place
at the table. The explanation of this virtuous retreat
soon made itself known in the person of a
visitor advancing up the garden. Clavering, who
had stumbled foolishly aside as she changed her
place, now opened the door and went to meet the
new-comer.</p>

<p>It was Romer’s manager, Mr. Thomas Lickwit,
discreet, obsequious, fawning, as ever,&mdash;but with
a covert malignity in his hurried words. “Sorry to
disturb you, sir. I see it is Miss Gladys’ lesson. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
hope the young lady is getting on nicely, sir. I
won’t detain you for more than a moment. I have
just a little matter that couldn’t wait. Business is
business, you know.”</p>

<p>Clavering felt as though he had heard this last
observation repeated “ad nauseam” by all the disgusting
sycophants in all the sensational novels he
had ever read. It occurred to him how closely Mr.
Lickwit really did resemble all these monotonously
unpleasant people.</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on the amiable man, “business is
business&mdash;even with reverend gentlemen like yourself
who have better things to attend to.” Clavering
forced himself to smile in genial appreciation of this
airy wit, and beckoned the manager into his study.
He then returned to the front room. “I am afraid
our lesson must end for tonight, Miss Romer,”
he said. “You know enough of this lieutenant
of your father’s to guess that he will not be easy
to get rid of. The worst of a parson’s life are these
interruptions.”</p>

<p>There was no smile upon his face as he said this,
but the girl laughed merrily. She adjusted her hat
with a deliciously coquettish glance at him through
the permissible medium of the gilt-framed mirror.
Then she turned and held out her hand. “Till next
week, then, Mr. Clavering. And I will read all those
books you sent up for me&mdash;even the great big black
one!”</p>

<p>He gravely opened the door for her, and with a
sigh from a heart “sorely charged,” returned to face
Mr. Lickwit.</p>

<p>He found that gentleman comfortably ensconced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
in the only arm-chair. “It is like this, sir,” said
the man, when Clavering had taken a seat opposite
him. “Mr. Romer thinks it would be a good thing
if this Social Meeting were put a stop to. There
has been talk, sir. I will not conceal it from you.
There has been talk. The people say that you
have allied yourself with that troublesome agitator.
You know the man I refer to, sir, that wretched
Wone.</p>

<p>“Mr. Romer doesn’t approve of what he hears of
these meetings. He doesn’t see as how they serve any
good purpose. He thinks they promote discord in
the place, and set one class against another. He does
not like the way, neither, that Mr. Quincunx has
been going on down there; nor to say the truth, sir,
do <em>I</em> like that gentleman’s doings very well. He
speaks too free, does Mr. Quincunx, much too free,
considering how he is situated as you might say.”</p>

<p>Clavering leapt to his feet, trembling with anger.
“I cannot understand this,” he said, “Someone has
been misleading Mr. Romer. The Social Meeting
is an old institution of this village; and though it is
not exactly a church affair, I believe it is almost
entirely frequented by church-goers. I have always
felt that it served an invaluable purpose in this place.
It is indeed the only occasion when priest and people
can meet on equal terms and discuss these great
questions man to man. No&mdash;no, Lickwit, I cannot
for a moment consent to the closing of the Social
Meeting. It would undo the work of years. It
would be utterly unwise. In fact it would be wrong.
I cannot think how you can come to me with such a
proposal.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lickwit made no movement beyond causing
his hat to twirl round on the top of the stick he held
between his knees.</p>

<p>“You will think better of it, sir. You will think
better of it,” he said. “The election is coming on,
and Mr. Romer expects all supporters of Church and
State to help him in his campaign. You have heard
he is standing, sir, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lickwit uttered the word “standing” in a
tone which suggested to Clavering’s mind a grotesque
image of the British Constitution resting like an enormous
cornucopia on the head of the owner of Leo’s
Hill. He nodded and resumed his seat. The manager
continued. “That old Methodist chapel where those
meetings are held, belongs, as you know, to Mr.
Romer. He is thinking of having it pulled down&mdash;not
only because of Wone’s and Quincunx’s goings on
there, but because he wants the ground. He’s thinking
of building an estate-office on that corner. We
are pressed for room, up at the Hill, sir.”</p>

<p>Once more Clavering rose to his feet. “This is too
much!” he cried. “I wonder you have the impertinence
to come here and tell me such things. I
am not to be bullied, Lickwit. Understand that!
I am not to be bullied.”</p>

<p>“Then I may tell the master,” said the man sneeringly,
rising in his turn and making for the door,
“that Mr. Parson won’t have nothing to do with
our little plan?”</p>

<p>“You may tell him what you please, Lickwit. I
shall go over myself at once to the House and see
Mr. Romer.” He glanced at his watch. “It is not
seven yet, and I know he does not dine till eight.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“By all means, sir, by all means! He’ll be extremely
glad to see you. You couldn’t do better, sir.
You’ll excuse me if I don’t walk up with you. I have
to run across and speak to Mr. Goring.”</p>

<p>He bowed himself out and hurried off. Clavering
seized his hat and followed him, turning, however,
when once in the street, in the direction of the south
drive. It took him scarcely a couple of minutes to
reach the village square where the drive emerged.
In the centre of the square stood a solid erection of
Leonian stone adapted to the double purpose of a
horse-trough and a drinking fountain. Here the
girls came to draw water, and here the lads came to
chat and flirt with the girls. Mr. Clavering could
not help pausing in his determined march to watch
a group of young people engaged in animated and
laughing frivolity at this spot. It was a man and
two girls. He recognized the man at once by his
slight figure and lively gestures. It was Luke Andersen.
“That fellow has a bad influence in this place,”
he said to himself. “He takes advantage of his
superior education to unsettle these children’s minds.
I must stop this.” He moved slowly towards the
fountain. Luke Andersen looked indeed as reckless
and engaging as a young faun out of a heathen
story. He was making a cup of his two hands and
whimsically holding up the water to the lips of the
younger of his companions, while the other one giggled
and fluttered round them. Had the priest been in
a poetic humour at that moment, he might have
been reminded of those queer mediæval legends of
the wanderings of the old dispossessed divinities.
The young stone-carver, with his classic profile and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
fair curly hair, might have passed for a disguised
Dionysus seducing to his perilous service the women
of some rustic Thessalian hamlet. No pleasing image
of this kind crossed Hugh Clavering’s vision. All he
saw, as he approached the fountain, was another
youthful incarnation of the dangerous Power he had
been wrestling with all the afternoon. He advanced
towards the engaging Luke, much as Christian might
have advanced towards Apollyon. “Good evening,
Andersen,” he said, with a certain professional severity.
“Using the fountain, I see? We must be careful,
though, not to waste the water this hot summer.”</p>

<p>The girl who was drinking rose up with a little
start, and stood blushing and embarrassed. Luke
appeared entirely at his ease. He leant negligently
against the edge of the stone trough, and pushed his
hat to the back of his head. In this particular pose
he resembled to an extraordinary degree the famous
Capitolian statue.</p>

<p>“It is hardly wasting the water, Mr. Clavering,”
he said with a smile, “offering it to a beautiful
mouth. Why don’t you curtsey to Mr. Clavering,
Annie? I thought all you girls curtsied when clergymen
spoke to you.”</p>

<p>The priest frowned. The audacious aplomb of the
young man unnerved and disconcerted him.</p>

<p>“Water in a stone fountain like this,” went on
the shameless youth, “has a peculiar charm these
hot evenings. It makes you almost fancy you are
in Seville. Seville is a place in Spain, Annie. Mr.
Clavering will tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>“I think Annie had better run in to her mother
now,” said the priest severely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” replied the youth with unruffled
urbanity. “Her mother has gone shopping in
Yeoborough and I have to see that Annie behaves
properly till she comes back.”</p>

<p>Clavering looked reproachfully at the girl. Something
about him&mdash;his very inability perhaps to cope
with this seductive Dionysus&mdash;struck her simple
intelligence as pathetic. She made a movement as
if to join her companion, who remained roguishly
giggling a few paces off. But Luke boldly restrained
her. Putting his hand on her shoulder he said
laughingly to the priest, “She will be a heart-breaker
one of these days, Mr. Clavering, will our Annie
here! You wouldn’t think she was eighteen, would
you, sir?”</p>

<p>Under other circumstances the young clergyman
would have unhesitatingly commanded the girl to go
home. But his recent experiences had loosened the
fibre of his moral courage. Besides, what was there
to prevent this incorrigible young man from walking
off after her? One could hardly&mdash;at least in Protestant
England&mdash;make one’s flock moral by sheer
force.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;good-night to you all,” he said, and
moved away, thinking to himself that at any rate
there was safety in publicity. “But what a dangerous
person that Andersen is! One never knows how
to deal with these half-and-half people. If he were
a village-boy it would be different. And it would be
different if he were a gentleman. But he is neither
one thing or the other. Seville! Who would have
thought to have heard Seville referred to, in the
middle of Nevilton Square?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>He reached the carved entrance of the House with
its deeply-cut armorial bearings&mdash;the Seldom falcon
with the arrow in its beak. “No more will <em>that</em> bird
fly,” he thought, as he waited for the door to open.</p>

<p>He was ushered into the spacious entrance hall,
the usual place of reception for Mr. Romer’s less
favoured guests. The quarry-owner was alone. He
shook hands affably with his visitor and motioned
him to a seat.</p>

<p>“I have come about that question of the Social
Meeting&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>Mr. Romer cut him short. “It is no longer a
question,” he said. “It is a ‘fait accompli.’ I have
given orders to have the place pulled down next
week. I want the space for building purposes.”</p>

<p>Clavering turned white with anger. “We shall have
to find another room then,” he said. “I cannot
have those meetings dropping out from our village
life. They keep the thoughtful people together as
nothing else can.”</p>

<p>Mr. Romer smiled grimly. “You will find it difficult
to discover another place,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Then I shall have them in my own house,” said
the vicar of Nevilton.</p>

<p>Mr. Romer crossed his hands and threw back his
head; looking, with the air of one who watches the
development of precisely foreseen events, straight
into the sad eyes of the little Royal Servant on the
wall.</p>

<p>“Pardon such a question, my friend,” said he, “but
may I ask you what your personal income is, at this
moment?”</p>

<p>“You know that well enough,” returned the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
“I have nothing beyond the hundred and fifty
pounds I receive as vicar of this place.”</p>

<p>“And what,” pursued the Quarry-owner, “may
your expenditure amount to?”</p>

<p>“That, also, you know well,” replied Clavering.
“I give away about eighty pounds, every year, to
the poor of this village.”</p>

<p>“And where does this eighty pounds come from?”
went on the Squire. The priest was silent.</p>

<p>“I will tell you where it comes from,” pronounced
the other. “It comes from me. It is my contribution,
out of the tithes which I receive as lay-rector.
And it is the larger part of them.”</p>

<p>The priest was still silent.</p>

<p>“When I first came here,” his interlocutor continued,
“I gave up these tithes as an offering to our
village necessities; and I have not yet withdrawn
them. If this Social Meeting, Mr. Clavering, is not
brought to an end, I shall withdraw them. And no
one will be able to blame me.”</p>

<p>Hugh jumped up on his feet with a gesture of
fury. “I call this,” he shouted, “nothing short of
sacrilege! Yes, sacrilege and tyranny! I shall proclaim
it abroad. I shall write to the papers. I shall
appeal to the bishop&mdash;to the country!”</p>

<p>“As you please,” said Mr. Romer quietly, “as you
please. I should only like to point out that any
action of this kind will tie up my purse-strings forever.
You will not be popular with your flock, my
friend. I know something of our dear Nevilton
people; and I shall have only to make it plain to
them that it is their vicar who has reduced this
charity; and you will not find yourself greatly loved!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Clavering fell back into his chair with a groan.
He knew too well the truth of the man’s words. He
knew also the straits into which this lack of money
would plunge half his benevolent activities in the
parish. He hung his head gloomily and stared at the
floor. What would he not have given, at that moment,
to have been able to meet this despot, man to
man, unencumbered by his duty to his people!</p>

<p>“Let me assure you, my dear sir,” said Mr. Romer
quietly, “that you are not by any means fighting
the cause of your church, in supporting this wretched
Meeting. If I were bidding you interrupt your
services or your sacraments, it would be another
matter. This Social Meeting has strong anti-clerical
prejudices. You know that, as well as I. It is
conducted entirely on nonconformist lines. I happen
to be aware,” he added, “since you talk of
appealing to the bishop, that the good man has already,
on more than one occasion, protested vigorously
against the association of his clergy with this
kind of organization. I do not know whether you
ever glance at that excellent paper the Guardian;
but if so you will find, in this last week’s issue, a
very interesting case, quite parallel to ours, in which
the bishop’s sympathies were by no means on the
side you are advocating.”</p>

<p>The young priest rose and bowed. “There is, at
any rate, no necessity for me to trouble you any
further,” he said. “So I will bid you good-night.”</p>

<p>He left the hall hastily, picked up his hat, and let
himself out, before his host had time to reply. All
the way down the drive his thoughts reverted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
seductive wiles of this despot’s daughter. “The
saints are deserting me,” he thought, “by reason of
my sin.”</p>

<p>He was not, even then, destined to escape his
temptress. Gladys, who doubtless had been expecting
this sudden retreat, emerged from the shadow of
the trees and intercepted him. “I will walk to the
gate with you,” she said. The power of feminine
attraction is never more insidious than at the moment
of bitter remorse. The mind reverts so easily,
so willingly, then, back to the dangerous way. The
mere fact of its having lost its pride of resistance, its
vanity of virtue, makes it yield to a new assault with
terrible facility. She drew him into the dusky twilight
of the scented exotic cedars which bordered the
way, on the excuse of inhaling their fragrance more
closely.</p>

<p>She made him pull down a great perfumed cypress-bough,
of some unusual species, so that they might
press their faces against it. They stood so closely
together that she could feel through her thin evening-gown
the furious trembling that seized him. She knew
that he had completely lost his self-control, and was
quite at her mercy. But Gladys had not the least
intention of yielding herself to the emotion she had
excited. What she intended was that he should
desire her to desperation, not that, by the least
touch, his desire should be gratified. In another
half-second, as she well knew, the poor priest would
have seized her in his arms. In place of permitting
this, what she did was to imprint a fleeting kiss with
her warm lips upon the back of his hand, and then
to leap out of danger with a ringing laugh. “Good-bye!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
she called back at him, as she ran off. “I’ll
come in good time next week.”</p>

<p>It may be imagined in what a turbulence of miserable
feelings Hugh Clavering repassed the village
square. He glanced quickly at the fountain. Yes!
Luke Andersen was still loitering in the same place,
and the little bursts of suppressed screams and
laughter, and the little fluttering struggles, of the
group around him, indicated that he was still, in his
manner, corrupting the maidens of Nevilton. The
priest longed to put his hands to his ears and run
down the street, even as Christian ran from the
city of Destruction. What was this power&mdash;this invincible,
all-pervasive power&mdash;against which he had
committed himself to contend? He felt as though
he were trying, with his poor human strength, to
hold back the sea-tide, so that it should not cover
the sands.</p>

<p>Could it be that, after all, the whole theory of the
church was wrong, and that the great Life-Force was
against her, and punishing her, for seeking, with
her vain superstitions, to alter the stars in their
courses?</p>

<p>Could it be that this fierce pleasure-lust, which he
felt so fatally in Gladys, and saw in Luke, and was
seduced by in his own veins, was after all the true
secret of Nature, and, to contend against it, madness
and impossible folly? Was he, and not they, the
really morbid and infatuated one&mdash;morbid with the
arbitrary pride of a desperate tradition of perverted
heroic souls? He moved along the pavement under
the church wall and looked up at its grand immovable
tower. “Are you, too,” he thought, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the symbol of an insane caprice in the mad human
race, seeking, in fond recklessness, to alter the basic
laws of the great World?”</p>

<p>The casuistical philosophy of Mr. Taxater returned
to his mind. What would the papal apologist say
to him now, thus torn and tugged at by all the
forces of hell? He felt a curious doubt in his heart
as to the side on which, in this mad struggle, the
astute theologian really stood. Perhaps, for all his
learning, the man was no more Christian in his true
soul, than had been many of those historic popes
whose office he defended. In his desperate mood
Clavering longed to get as near as possible to the
altar of this God of his, who thus bade him confront
the whole power of nature and all the wisdom of the
world. He looked up and down the street. Two men
were talking outside The Goat and Boy, but their
backs were turned. With a quick sudden movement
he put his hands on the top of the wall and scrambled
hastily over, scraping his shins as he did so on a
sharp stone at the top. He moved rapidly to the
place where rose the strange tombstone designed by
the atheist carver. It was here that Vennie and he
had entered into their heroic covenant only twenty-four
hours before. He looked at the enormous skull
so powerfully carved and at the encircled cross beneath
it. He laid his hand upon the skull, precisely
as he had done the night before; only this time there
were no little cold fingers to instil pure devotion into
him. Instead of the touch of such fingers he felt the
burning contact of Gladys’ soft lips.</p>

<p>No! it was an impossible task that his God had laid
upon him. Why not give up the struggle? Why not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
throw over this mad idol of purity he had raised for his
worship, and yield himself to the great stream? The
blood rushed to his head with the alluring images that
this thought evoked. Perhaps, after all, Gladys would
marry him, and then&mdash;why, then, he could revert
to the humourous wisdom of Mr. Taxater, and cultivate
the sweet mystical speculations of modernism;
reconciling, pleasantly and easily, the natural pleasures
of the senses, with the natural exigencies of the soul!</p>

<p>He left Gideon’s grave and walked back to the
church-porch. It was now nearly dark and without
fear of being observed by any one through the iron
bars of the outer gate, he entered the porch and stood
before the closed door. He wished he had brought
the key with him. How he longed, at that moment,
to fling himself down before the altar and cry aloud
to his God!</p>

<p>By his side stood the wheeled parish bier, ornamented
by a gilt inscription, informing the casual
intruder that it had been presented to the place in
honour of the accession of King George the Fifth.
There was not light enough to read these touching
words, but the gilt plate containing them gave forth
a faint scintillating glimmer.</p>

<p>Worn out by the day-long struggle in his heart,
Clavering sat down upon this grim “memento mori”;
and then, after a minute or two, finding that position
uncomfortable, deliberately stretched himself out at
full length upon the thing’s bare surface. Lying here,
with the bats flitting in and out above his head, the
struggle in his mind continued. Supposing he did
yield,&mdash;not altogether, of course; his whole nature
was against that, and his public position stood in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
way,&mdash;but just a little, just a hair’s breadth, could
he not enjoy a light playful flirtation with Gladys,
such as she was so obviously prepared for, even if it
were impossible to marry her? The worst of it was
that his imagination so enlarged upon the pleasures
of this “playful flirtation,” that it very quickly became
an obsessing desire. He propped himself up
upon his strange couch and looked forth into the
night. The stars were just beginning to appear, and
he could see one or two constellations whose names
he knew. How indifferent they were, those far-off
lights! What did it matter to them whether he yielded
or did not yield? He had the curious sensation that
the whole conflict in which he was entangled belonged
to a terrestrial sphere infinitely below those heavenly
luminaries. Not only the Power against which he
contended, but the Power on whose side he fought,
seemed out-distanced and derided by those calm
watchers.</p>

<p>He sank back again and gazed up at the carved
stone roof above him. A dull inert weariness stole
over his brain; a sick disgust of the whole mad
business of a man’s life upon earth. Why was he born
into the world with passions that he must not satisfy
and ideals that he could not hold? Better not to have
been born at all; or, being born, better to lie quiet
and untroubled, with all these placid churchyard
people, under the heavy clay! The mental weariness
that assailed him gradually changed into sheer physical
drowsiness. His head sought instinctively a more
easy position and soon found what it sought. His
eyes closed; and there, upon the parish bier, worn
out with his struggle against Apollyon, the vicar of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Nevilton slept. When he returned to consciousness
he found himself cramped, cold and miserable. Hurriedly
he scrambled to his feet, stretched his stiff
limbs and listened. The clock in the Tower above him
began to strike. It struck one&mdash;two&mdash;and then
stopped. He had slept for nearly five hours.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ORCHARD</span></h2>

<p>Every natural locality has its hour of special
self-assertion; its hour, when the peculiar qualities
and characteristics which belong to it
emphasize themselves, and attain a sort of temporary
apogee or culmination. It is then that such localities&mdash;be
they forests or moors, hill-sides or valleys&mdash;seem
to gather themselves together and bring themselves
into focus, waiting expectantly, it might almost seem,
for some answering dramatic crisis in human affairs
which should find in them an inevitable background.</p>

<p>One of the chief features of our English climate is
that no two successive days, even in a spell of the
warmest weather, are exactly alike. What one might
call the culminant day of that summer, for the orchards
of Nevilton, arrived shortly after Mr. Clavering’s
unfortunate defeat. Every hour of this day
seemed to add something more and more expressive to
their hushed and expectant solitudes.</p>

<p>Though the hay had been cut, or was being cut, in
the open fields, in these shadowy recesses the grass
was permitted to grow lush and long, at its own
unimpeded will.</p>

<p>Between the ancient trunks of the moss-grown
apple-trees hung a soft blue vapour; and the flickering
sunlight that pierced the denser foliage, threw
shadows upon the heavy grass that were as deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
purple as the waves of the mid-atlantic. There
was indeed something so remote from the ordinary
movements of the day about this underworld of
dim, rich seclusion, that the image of a sleepy wave-lulled
land, long sunken out of reach of human invasion,
under the ebbing and flowing tide, seemed
borne in naturally upon the imagination.</p>

<p>It was towards the close of the afternoon of this
particular segment of time that the drowsy languor of
these orchards reached its richest and most luxurious
moment. Grass, moss, lichen, mistletoe, gnarled
trunks, and knotted roots, all seemed to cry aloud,
at this privileged hour, for some human recognition of
their unique quality; some human event which should
give that quality its dramatic value, its planetary
proportion. Not since the Hesperidean Dragon
guarded its sacred charge, in the classic story, has
a more responsive background offered itself to what
Catullus calls the “furtive loves” of mortal men.</p>

<p>About six o’clock, on this day of the apogee of the
orchards, Mr. Romer, seated on the north terrace
of his house, caught sight of his daughter and her
companion crossing the near corner of the park. He
got up at once, and walked across the garden to intercept
them. The sight of the Italian’s slender drooping
figure, as she lingered a little behind her cousin,
roused into vivid consciousness all manner of subterranean
emotions in the quarry-owner’s mind. He
felt as an oriental pasha might feel, when under the
stress of some political or monetary transaction, he
is compelled to hand over his favorite girl-slave to
an obsequious dependent. The worst of it was that
he could not be absolutely sure of Mr. Goring’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
continued adherence. It was within the bounds of
possibility that once in possession of Lacrima, the
farmer might breathe against him gross Thersites-like
defiance, and carry off his captive to another
county. He experienced, at that moment, a sharp
pang of inverted remorse at the thought of having
to relinquish his prey.</p>

<p>As he strode along by the edge of the herbaceous
borders, where the blue spikes of the delphiniums were
already in bud, his mind swung rapidly from point
to point in the confused arena of his various contests
and struggles.</p>

<p>Mixed strangely enough with his direct Napoleonic
pursuit of wealth and power, there was latent in
Mr. Romer, as we have already hinted, a certain
dark and perverse sensuality, which was capable of
betraying and distorting, in very curious ways, the
massive force of his intelligence.</p>

<p>At this particular moment, as he emerged into the
park, he found himself beginning to regret his conversation
with his brother-in-law. But, after all, he
thought, when Gladys married, it would be difficult
to find any reason for keeping Lacrima at his side.
His feelings towards the girl were a curious mixture
of attraction and hatred. And what could better
gratify this mixed emotion than a plan which would
keep her within his reach and at the same time
humiliate and degrade her? To do the master of
Nevilton justice, he was not, at that moment, as he
passed under a group of Spanish chestnuts and observed
the object of his conspiracy rendered gentler
and more fragile than ever by the loveliness of her
surroundings, altogether devoid of a certain remote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
feeling of compunction. He crushed it down, however,
by his usual thought of the brevity and futility of
all these things, and the folly of yielding to weak
commiseration, when, in so short a time, nothing,
one way or the other, would matter in the least!
He had long ago trained himself to make use of these
materialistic reasonings to suppress any irrelevant
prickings of conscience which might interfere with
the bias of his will. The whole world, looked at with
the bold cynical eye of one who was not afraid to
face the truth, was, after all, a mad, wild, unmeaning
struggle; and, in the confused arena of this struggle,
one could be sure of nothing but the pleasure one
derived from the sensation of one’s own power. He
tried, as he walked towards the girls, to imagine to
himself what his feelings would be, supposing he yielded
to these remote scruples, and let Lacrima go, giving
her money, for instance, to enable her to live independently
in her own country, or to marry whom she
pleased. She would no doubt marry that damned
fool Quincunx! Lack of money was, assuredly, all
that stood in the way. And how could he contemplate
an idea of that kind with any pleasure? He
wondered, in a grim humourous manner, what sort of
compensation these self-sacrificing ones really got?
What satisfaction would <em>he</em> get, for instance, in the
consciousness that he had thrown a girl who attracted
him, into the arms of an idiot who excited his hate?</p>

<p>He looked long at Lacrima, as she stood with
Gladys, under a sycamore, waiting his approach. It
was curious, he said to himself,&mdash;very curious,&mdash;the
sort of feelings she excited in him. It was not that
he wished to possess her. He was scornfully cynical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of that sort of gratification. He wished to do more
than possess her. He wished to humiliate her, to
degrade her, to put her to shame in her inmost spirit.
He wished her to know that he knew that she was
suffering this shame, and that he was the cause of it.
He wished her to feel herself absolutely in his power,
not bodily&mdash;that was nothing!&mdash;but morally, and
spiritually.</p>

<p>The owner of Leo’s Hill had the faculty of detaching
himself from his own darkest thoughts, and
of observing them with a humourous and cynical eye.
It struck him as not a little grotesque, that he, the
manipulater of far-flung financial intrigues, the ambitious
politician, the formidable captain of industry,
should be thus scheming and plotting to satisfy the
caprice of a mere whim, upon the destiny of a
penniless dependent. It <em>was</em> grotesque&mdash;grotesque
and ridiculous. Let it be! The whole business of
living was grotesque and ridiculous. One snatched
fiercely at this thing or the other, as the world moved
round; and one was not bound always to present
oneself in a dignified mask before one’s own tribunal.
It was enough that this or that fantasy of the dominant
power-instinct demanded a certain course of
action. Let it be as grotesque as it might! He, and
none other, was the judge of his pleasure, of what he
pleased to do, or to refrain from doing. It was his
humour;&mdash;and that ended it! He lived to fulfil his
humour. There was nothing else to live for, in this
fantastic chaotic world! Meditating in this manner
he approached the girls.</p>

<p>“It occurred to me,” he said, breathing a little
hard, and addressing his daughter, “that you might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
be seeing Mr. Clavering again tonight. If so, perhaps
you would give him a message from me, or
rather,&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;a suggestion, a
gentle hint.”</p>

<p>“What are you driving at, father?” asked Gladys,
pouting her lips and swinging her parasol.</p>

<p>“It is a message best delivered by mouth,” Mr.
Romer went on, “and by your mouth.”</p>

<p>Then as if to turn this last remark into a delicate
compliment, he playfully lifted up the girl’s chin
with his finger and made as if to kiss her. Gladys,
however, lightly evaded him, and tossing her head
mischievously, burst out laughing. “I know you,
father, I know you,” she cried. “You want me to
do some intriguing for you. You never kiss me like
that, unless you do!”</p>

<p>Lacrima glanced apprehensively at the two of
them. Standing there, in the midst of that charming
English scene, they represented to her mind all that
was remorseless, pitiless and implacable in this island
of her enforced adoption. Swiftly, from those ruddy
pinnacles of the great house behind them, her mind
reverted to the little white huts in a certain Apennine
valley and the tinkling bells of the goats led back
from pasture. Oh how she hated all this heavy
foliage and these eternally murmuring doves!</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Romer, as Gladys waited mockingly,
“I do want you to do something. I want you
to hint to our dear clergyman that this ceremony
of your reception into his church is dependent upon
his good behaviour. Not <em>your</em> good behavior,” he
repeated smiling, “but <em>his</em>. The truth is, dear child,
if I may speak quite plainly, I know the persuasive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
power of your pretty face over all these young men;
and I want you to make it plain to this worthy
priest that if you are to continue being nice to him,
he must be very nice to <em>me</em>. Do you catch my meaning,
my plump little bird?” As he spoke he encircled
her waist with his arm. Lacrima, watching them,
thought how singularly alike father and daughter
were, and was conscious of an instinctive desire to
run and warn this new victim of conspiracy.</p>

<p>“Why, what has he been doing, father?” asked
the fair girl, shaking herself free, and opening her
parasol.</p>

<p>“He has been supporting that fellow Wone. And
he has been talking nonsense about Quincunx,&mdash;yes,
about your friend Quincunx,” he added, nodding
ironically towards Lacrima.</p>

<p>“And I am to punish him, am I?” laughed Gladys.
“That is lovely! I love punishing people, especially
people like Mr. Clavering who think they are so
wonderfully good!”</p>

<p>Mr. Romer smiled. “Not exactly punish him,
dear, but lead him gently into the right path. Lead
him, in fact, to see that the party to belong to in
this village is the party of capacity&mdash;not the party
of chatter.”</p>

<p>Gladys looked at her father seriously. “You don’t
mean that you are actually afraid of losing this election?”
she said. Mr. Romer stretched out his arm
and rested himself against the umbrageous sycamore,
pressing his large firm hand upon its trunk.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>“Losing it, child? No, I shan’t lose it. But these
idiots do really annoy me. They are all such cowards
and such sentimental babies. It is people like these who
have to be ruled with a firm hand. They cringe and
whimper when you talk to them; and then the moment
your back is turned they grow voluble and impertinent.
My workmen are no better. They owe everything
to me. If it wasn’t for me, half those quarries
would be shut down tomorrow and they’d be out of
a job. But do you think they are grateful? Not
a bit of it!” His tone grew more angry. He felt
a need of venting the suppressed rage of many
months. “Yes, you needn’t put on that unconscious
look, Lacrima. I know well enough where <em>your</em>
sympathies lie. The fact is, in these rotten days,
it is the incapable and miserable who give the tone
to everyone! No one thinks for himself. No one
goes to the bottom of things. It is all talk&mdash;talk&mdash;talk;
talk about equality, about liberty, about kindness
to the weak. I hate the weak; and I refuse to
let them interfere with me! Look at the faces of these
people. Well,&mdash;you know, Gladys, what they are
like. They are all feeble, bloodless, sneaking, fawning
idiots! I hate the faces of these Nevilton fools.
They are always making me think of slugs and worms.
This Wone is typical. His disgusting complexion
and flabby mouth is characteristic of them all. No
one of them has the spirit to hit one properly back,
face to face. And their odious, sentimental religion!&mdash;This
Clavering of yours ought to know better. He
is not quite devoid of intelligence. He showed some
spirit when I talked with him. But he is besotted,
too, with this silly nonsense about humouring the
people, and considering the people, and treating the
people in a Christian spirit! As though you could
treat worms and slugs in any other spirit than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
spirit of trampling upon them. They are born to be
trampled upon&mdash;born for it&mdash;I tell you! You have
only to look at them!” He glared forth over the
soft rich fields; and continued, still more bitterly:</p>

<p>“It’s no good your pretending not to hear me,
Lacrima! I can read your thoughts like an open
book. You are quoting to yourself, no doubt, at
this very moment, some of the pretty speeches of
your friend Quincunx. A nice fellow, he is, for a
girl’s teacher! A fellow with no idea of his own in
his head! A fellow afraid to raise his eyes above
one’s boot-laces! Why the other day, when I was
out shooting and met him in the lane, he turned
straight round, and walked back on his tracks&mdash;simply
from fear of passing me. I hate these sneaking
cowards! I hate their cunning, miserable, little
ways! I should like to trample them all out of
existence! That is the worst of being strong in this
world. One is worried to death by a lot of fools who
are not worth the effort spent on them.”</p>

<p>Lacrima uttered no word, but looked sadly away,
over the fair landscape. In her heart, in spite of her
detestation of the man, she felt a strange fantastic
sympathy with a good deal of what he said. Women,
especially women of Latin races, have no great respect
for democratic sentiments when they do not issue in
definite deeds. Her private idea of a revolutionary
leader was something very far removed from the
voluble local candidate, and she had suffered too
much herself from the frail petulance of Maurice
Quincunx not to feel a secret longing that somewhere,
somehow, this aggressive tyrant should be faced by a
strength as firm, as capable, as fearless, as his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Romer, with his swarthy imperial face and
powerful figure, seemed to her, as he leant against
the tree, so to impress himself upon that yielding
landscape, that there appeared reason enough for his
complaint that he could find no antagonist worthy
of his steel. In the true manner of a Pariah, who
turns, with swift contempt, upon her own class, the
girl was conscious of a rising tide of revolt in her
heart against the incompetent weakness of her friend.
What would she not give to be able, even once, to
see this man outfaced and outwitted! She was impressed
too, poor girl, as she shrank silently aside
from his sarcasm, by the horrible indifference of these
charming sunlit fields to the brutality of the man’s
challenge. They cared nothing&mdash;nothing! It was
impossible to make them care. Hundreds of years
ago they had slumbered, just as dreamily, just as
indifferently, as they did now. If even at this
moment she were to plunge a knife into the man’s
heart, so that he fell a mass of senseless clay at her
feet, that impervious wood-pigeon would go on murmuring
its monotonous ditty, just as peacefully, just
as serenely! There was something really terrifying
to her in this callous indifference of Nature. It was
like living perpetually in close contact with a person
who was deaf and dumb and blind; and who, while
the most tragic events were being transacted, went
on cheerfully and imperturbably humming some merry
tune. It would be almost better, thought the girl,
if that tree-trunk against which the quarry-owner
pressed his heavy hand were really in league with
him. Anything were better than this smiling indifference
which seemed to keep on repeating in a voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
as monotonous as the pigeon’s&mdash;“Everything is
permitted. Nothing is forbidden. Nothing is forbidden.
Everything is permitted.” like the silly
reiterated whirring of some monstrous placid shuttle.
It was strange, the rebellious inconsistent thoughts,
which passed through her mind! She wondered why
Hugh Clavering was thus to be waylaid and persuaded.
Had he dared to rise in genuine opposition?
No, she did not believe it. He had probably talked
religion, just as Maurice talked anarchy and Wone
talked socialism. It was all talk! Romer was quite
right. They had no spirit in them, these English
people. She thought of the fierce atheistic rebels of
her own country. <em>They</em>, at any rate, understood that
evil had to be resisted by action, and not by vague
protestations of unctuous sentiment!</p>

<p>When Mr. Romer left them and returned to his
seat on the terrace, the girls did not at once proceed
on their way, but waited, hesitating; and amused
themselves by pulling down the lower branches of a
lime and trying to anticipate the sweetness of its yet
unbudded fragrance.</p>

<p>“Let’s stroll down the drive first,” said Gladys
presently, “till we are out of sight, and then we can
cross the mill mead and get into the orchard that
way.” They followed this design with elaborate
caution, and only when quite concealed from the
windows of the house, turned quickly northward and
left the park for the orchards. Between the wall,
of the north garden and the railway, lay some of the
oldest and least frequented of these shadowy places,
completely out of the ordinary paths of traffic, and
only accessible by field-ways. Into the smallest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
most secluded of all these the girls wandered, gliding
noiselessly between the thick hedges and heavy grass,
like two frail phantoms of the upper world visiting
some Elysian solitude.</p>

<p>Gladys laid her hand on her companion’s arm.
“We had better wait here,” she said, “where we can
see the whole orchard. They ought to know, by now,
where to come.”</p>

<p>They seated themselves on the bowed trunk of an
ancient apple-tree that by long decline had at last
reached a horizontal position. The flowering season
was practically over, though here and there a late
cider-tree, growing more in shadow than the rest,
still carried its delicate burden of clustered blossoms.</p>

<p>“How many times is it that we have met them
here?” whispered the fair girl, snatching off her hat
and tossing it on the grass. “This is the fifth time,
isn’t it? What dear things they are! I think it’s
much more exciting, this sort of thing,&mdash;don’t you?&mdash;than
dull tennis parties with silly idiots like young
Ilminster.”</p>

<p>The Italian nodded. “It is a good thing that
James and I get on so well,” she said. “It would
be awkward if we were as afraid of one another as
when we first met.”</p>

<p>Gladys put her hand caressingly on her companion’s
knee and looked into her face with a slow seductive
smile.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<p>“You are forgetting your Mr. Quincunx a little,
just a little, these days, aren’t you, darling? Don’t
be shy, now&mdash;or look cross. You know you are!
You can’t deny it. Your boy is almost as nice as
mine. He doesn’t like me, though. I can see that!
But I like <em>him</em>. I like him awfully! You’d better
take care, child. If ever I get tired of my Luke&mdash;”</p>

<p>“James isn’t a boy,” protested Lacrima.</p>

<p>“Silly!” cried Gladys. “Of course he is. Who
cares about age? They are all the same. I always
call them boys when they attract me. I like the
word. I like to say it. It makes me feel as if I
were one of those girls in London. You know what I
mean!”</p>

<p>Lacrima looked at her gravely. “I always feel as
if James Andersen were much older than I,” she said.</p>

<p>“But your Mr. Quincunx,” repeated the fair
creature, slipping her soft fingers into her friend’s
hand, “your Mr. Quincunx is not quite what he was
to you, before we began these adventures?”</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t say that, Gladys!” rejoined
the Italian, freeing her hands and clasping them
passionately together. “It is wicked of you to say
that! You know I only talk to James so that you
can do what you like. I shall always be Maurice’s
friend. I shall be his friend to the last!”</p>

<p>Gladys laughed merrily. “That is what I wanted,”
she retorted. “I wanted to make you burst out.
When people burst out, they are always doubtful in
their hearts. Ah, little puritan! so we are already in
the position of having two sweethearts, are we?&mdash;and
not knowing which of the two we really like best?
That is a very pretty situation to be in. It is where
we all are! I hope you enjoy it!”</p>

<p>Lacrima let her hands fall helplessly to her side,
against the grey bark of the apple-tree. “Why do
you hate Mr. Quincunx so?” she asked, looking
gravely into her friend’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why do I hate him?” said Gladys. “Oh, I really
don’t know! I didn’t know I did. If I do, it’s
because he’s such a weak wretched creature. He has
no more spirit than a sick dog. He talks such nonsense
too! I am glad he has to walk to Yeoborough
every day and do a little work. You ought to be
glad too! He could never marry if he didn’t make
some money.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t want to marry,” murmured Lacrima.
“He only wants to be left alone.”</p>

<p>“A nice friend he seems to be,” cried the other,
“for a girl like you! I suppose he kisses you and that
sort of thing, doesn’t he? I shouldn’t like to be
kissed by a silly old man like that, with a great
stupid beard.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t say these things to me, Gladys, you
mustn’t! I won’t hear them. Mr. Quincunx isn’t
an old man! He is younger than James Andersen.
He is not forty yet.”</p>

<p>“He looks fifty, if he looks a day,” said Gladys,
“and the colour of his beard is disgusting! It’s like
dirty water. Fancy having a horrid thing like that
pressed against your face! And I suppose he cries
and slobbers over you, doesn’t he? I have seen him
cry. I hate a man who cries. He cried the other
night,&mdash;father told me so&mdash;when he found he had
spent all his money.”</p>

<p>Lacrima got up and walked a few paces away.
She loathed this placid golden-haired creature, at that
moment, so intensely, that it was all she could do to
refrain from leaping upon her and burying her teeth
in her soft neck. She leant against one of the trees
and pressed her head upon its grey lichen. Gladys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
slipped down into a more luxurious position. She
looked complacently around her. No spot could have
been better adapted for a romantic encounter.</p>

<p>The gnarled and time-worn trunks of the old apple-trees,
each looking as if it had lingered there, full of
remote memories, from an age coeval with the age of
those very druids whose sacred mistletoe still clung
in patches to their boughs, formed a strange fantastic
array of twisted and distorted natural pillars, upon
which the foliage, meeting everywhere above their
heads, leaned in shadowy security, like the roof of a
heathen temple. The buttercups and cuckoo-flowers,
which, here and there, sprinkled the heavy grass,
were different from those in the open meadows.
The golden hue of the one, and the lavender tint of
the other, took on, in this diurnal gloom, a chilly and
tender pallour, both colours approximating to white.
The grey lichen hung down in loose festoons from the
higher portions of the knotted trunks, and crept,
thick and close, round the moss at their roots. There
could hardly be conceived a spot more suggestive of
absolute and eternal security than this Hesperidean
enclosure.</p>

<p>The very fact of the remote but constant presence
of humanity there, as a vague dreamy background of
immemorial tending, increased this sense. One felt
that the easy invasions of grafting-time and gathering-time,
returning perennially in their seasons, only
intensified the long delicious solitudes of the intervals
between, when, in rich, hushed languor, the blossoms
bud and bloom and fall; and the fruit ripens and
sweetens; and the leaves flutter down. That exquisite
seductive charm, the charm of places full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
quietness, yet bordering on the edge of the days’
labour, hung like a heavy atmosphere of contentment
over the shadowy aisles of this temple of peace. The
wood-pigeons keep up a perpetual murmur, all the
summer long, in these untrodden spots. No eyes see
them. It is as though they never saw one another.
But their drowsy liturgical repetitions answer and
answer again, as if from the unfathomable depths of
some dim green underworld, worshipping the gods of
silence with sounds that give silence itself a richer, a
fuller weight.</p>

<p>“There they are!” cried Gladys suddenly, as the
figures of the Andersen brothers made themselves
visible on the further side of the orchard.</p>

<p>The girls advanced to meet them through the thick
grass, swinging their summer-hats in their hands and
bending their heads, now and then, to avoid the
overhanging boughs. The meeting between these
four persons would have made a pleasant and appropriate
subject for one of those richly-coloured old-fashioned
prints which one sometimes observes in
early Victorian parlours. Gladys grew quite pale with
excitement, and her voice assumed a vibrant tenderness
when she accosted Luke, which made Lacrima
give a little start of surprise, as she shook hands with
the elder brother. Had her persecutor then, got,
after all, some living tissue in the place where the
heart beat?</p>

<p>Luke’s manner had materially altered since he had
submitted so urbanely to the fair girl’s insulting airs
at the close of their first encounter. His way of
treating her now was casual, flippant, abrupt&mdash;almost
indifferent. Instead of following the pathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
pressure of her arm and hand, which at once bade
him hasten the separation of the group, he deliberately
lingered, chatting amicably with Lacrima and asking
her questions about Italy. It seemed that the plausible
Luke knew quite as much about Genoa and
Florence and Venice as his more taciturn brother, and
all he knew he was well able to turn into effective
use. He was indeed a most engaging and irresistible
conversationalist; and Gladys grew paler and paler,
as she watched the animation of his face and listened
to his pleasant and modulated voice.</p>

<p>It caused sheer suffering to her fiercely impetuous
nature, this long-drawn out delay. Every moment
that passed diminished the time they would have
together. Her nerves ached for the touch of his
arms about her, and a savage desire to press her
mouth to his, and satiate herself with kisses, throbbed
in her every vein. Why would he not stop this
irrelevant stream of talk? What did she care about
the narrow streets of Genoa,&mdash;or the encrusted
façade of San Marco? It had been their custom to
separate immediately on meeting, and for Luke to
carry her off to a charming hiding-place they had
discovered. With the fierce pantherish craving of a
love-scorched animal her soul cried out to be clasped
close to her friend in this secluded spot, having her
will of those maddening youthful lips with their proud
Grecian curve! Still he must go on talking!</p>

<p>James and Lacrima, lending themselves, naturally
and easily, to the mood of the moment, were already
seated at the foot of a twisted and ancestral apple-tree.
Soon Luke, still absorbed in his conversation
with the Italian, shook off Gladys’ arm and settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
himself beside them, plucking a handful of grass, as
he did so, and inhaling its fragrance with sybarite
pleasure.</p>

<p>“St. Mark’s is the only church in the world for
me,” Luke was saying. “I have pictures of it from
every conceivable angle. It is quite a mania with me
collecting such things. I have dozens of them;
haven’t I, James?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean those post-cards father sent home
when he went over there to work?” answered the
elder brother, one of whose special peculiarities was
a curious pleasure in emphasizing, in the presence of
the “upper classes,” the humility of his origin.</p>

<p>Luke laughed. “Well&mdash;yes&mdash;those&mdash;and others,”
he said. “<em>You</em> haven’t the least idea what I keep
in my drawer of secret treasures; you know you
haven’t! I’ve got some lovely letters there among
other things. Letters that I wouldn’t let anyone see
for the world!” He glanced smilingly at Gladys, who
was pacing up and down in front of them, like a
beautiful tigress.</p>

<p>“Look here, my friends,” she said. “The time is
slipping away frightfully. We are not going to sit
here all the while, are we, talking nonsense, like
people at a garden party?”</p>

<p>“It’s so lovely here,” said Luke with a slow smile.
“I really don’t think that your favourite corner is so
much nicer. I am in no hurry to move. Are you,
Miss Traffio?”</p>

<p>Lacrima saw a look upon her cousin’s face that
boded ill for their future relations if she did not
make some kind of effort. She rose to her feet.</p>

<p>“Come, Mr. Andersen,” she said, giving James a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
wistful look. “Let us take a little stroll, and then
return again to these young people.”</p>

<p>James rose obediently, and they walked off together.
They passed from the orchards belonging to
Mr. Romer’s tenant, and entered those immediately
at the foot of the vicarage garden. Here, through a
gap in the hedge they were attracted by the sight of
a queer bed of weeds growing at the edge of a potato-patch.
They were very curious weeds, rather resembling
sea-plants than land-plants; in colour of a
dull glaucous green, and in shape grotesquely elongated.</p>

<p>“What are those things?” said Lacrima. “I think
I have never seen such evil-looking plants. Why do
they let them grow there?”</p>

<p>James surveyed the objects. “They certainly have
a queer look,” he said, “but you know, in old days,
there was a grave-yard here, of a peculiar kind. It
is only in the last fifty years that they have dug it
up and included it in this garden.”</p>

<p>Lacrima shuddered. “I would not eat those potatoes
for anything! You know I think I come to
dislike more and more the look of your English vegetable
gardens, with their horrid, heavy leaves, so
damp and oozy and disgusting!”</p>

<p>“I agree with you there,” returned the wood-carver.
“I have always hated Nevilton, and every
aspect of it; but I think I hate these overgrown
gardens most of all.”</p>

<p>“They look as if they were fed from churchyards,
don’t they?” went on the girl. “Look at those
heavy laurel bushes over there, and those dreadful
fir-trees! I should cut them all down if this place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
belonged to me. Oh, how I long for olives and vine-yards!
These orchards are all very well, but they
seem to me as if they were made to keep out the sun
and the wholesome air.”</p>

<p>James Andersen smiled grimly. “Orchards and
potato gardens!” he muttered. “Yes, these are typical
of this country of clay. And these Vicarage shrubberies!
I think a shrubbery is the last limit of
depression and desolation. I am sure all the murders
committed in this country are planned in shrubberies,
and under the shade of damp laurel-bushes.”</p>

<p>“In our country we grow corn between the fruit-trees,”
said Lacrima.</p>

<p>“Yes, corn&mdash;” returned Andersen, “corn and wine
and oil! Those are the natural, the beautiful,
products of the earth. Things that are fed upon sun
and air&mdash;not upon the bones of the dead! All these
Nevilton places, however luxuriant, seem to me to
smell of death.”</p>

<p>“But was this corner really a churchyard?” asked
the Italian. “I hope Mrs. Seldom won’t stroll down
this way and see us!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Seldom is well suited to the place she lives
in,” returned the other. “She lives upon the Past,
just as her garden does&mdash;just as her potatoes do!
These English vicarages are dreadful places. They
have all the melancholy of age without its historic
glamour. And how morbid they are! Any of your
cheerful Latin curés would die in them, simply of
damp and despair.”</p>

<p>“But do tell me about this spot,” repeated Lacrima,
with a little shiver. “Why did you say it
was a peculiar churchyard?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was the place where they buried unbaptized
children,” answered Andersen, and added, in a lower
tone, “how cold it is getting! It must be the shadow
we are in.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t yet,” murmured Lacrima, “you
haven’t yet told me, what those weeds are.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;we call them ‘mares’-tails’ about here,”
answered the stone-carver, “I don’t know their
proper name.”</p>

<p>“But why don’t they dig them up? Look! They
are growing all among the potatoes.”</p>

<p>“They can’t dig them up,” returned the man.
“They can’t get at their roots. They are the worst
and most obstinate weed there is. They grow in all
the Nevilton gardens. They are the typical Nevilton
flora. They must have grown here in the days of
the druids.”</p>

<p>“But how absurd!” cried Lacrima. “I feel as if
I could pull them up with my hands. The earth
looks so soft.”</p>

<p>“The earth is soft enough,” replied Andersen, “but
the roots of these weeds adhere fast to the rock
underneath. The rock, you know, the sandstone
rock, lies only a short distance beneath our feet.”</p>

<p>“The same stone as Nevilton house is built of?”</p>

<p>“Certainly the same. Our stone, Mr. Romer’s
stone, the stone upon which we all live here&mdash;except
those who till the fields.”</p>

<p>“I hate the thing!” cried Lacrima, in curious
agitation.</p>

<p>“You do? Well&mdash;to tell you the honest truth,
so do I. I associate it with my father.”</p>

<p>“I associate it with Gladys,” whispered Lacrima.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can believe it. We both associate it with
houses of tyranny, of wretched persecution. Perhaps
I have never told you that my father was directly
the cause of my mother’s death?”</p>

<p>“You have hinted it,” murmured the girl. “I
suspected it. But Luke loves the stone, doesn’t he?
He always speaks as if the mere handling of it, in his
work-shop, gave him exquisite pleasure.”</p>

<p>“A great many things give Luke exquisite pleasure,”
returned the other grimly. “Luke lives for exquisite
pleasure.”</p>

<p>A quick step on the grass behind them made them
swing suddenly round. It was Vennie Seldom, who,
unobserved, had been watching them from the
vicarage terrace. A few paces behind her came Mr.
Taxater, walking cautiously and deliberately, with
the air of a Lord Chesterfield returning from an
audience at St. James’. Mr. Taxater had already
met the Italian on one or two occasions. He had
sat next to her once, when dining at Nevilton House,
and he was considerably interested in her.</p>

<p>“What a lovely evening, Miss Traffio,” said Vennie
shyly, but without embarrassment. Vennie was
always shy, but nothing ever interfered with her
self-possession.</p>

<p>“I am glad you are showing Mr. Andersen these
orchards of ours. I always think they are the most
secluded place in the whole village.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” said Mr. Taxater, when he had greeted
them with elaborate and friendly courtesy, “I thought
you two were bound to make friends sooner or later!
I call you my two companions in exile, among our
dear Anglo-Saxons. Miss Traffio I know is Latin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and you, sir, must have some kind of foreign blood.
I am right, am I not, Mr. Andersen?”</p>

<p>James looked at him humorously, though a little
grimly. He was always pleased to be addressed by
Mr. Taxater, as indeed was everybody who knew him.
The great scholar’s detached intellectualism gave him
an air of complete aloofness from all social distinctions.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may have,” he answered. “My
mother used to hint at something of the kind. She
was always very fond of foreign books. I rather
fancy that I once heard her say something about a
strain of Spanish blood.”</p>

<p>“I thought so! I thought so!” cried Mr. Taxater,
pulling his hat over his eyes and protruding his
chin and under-lip, in the manner peculiar to him
when especially pleased.</p>

<p>“I thought there was something Spanish in you.
How extraordinarily interesting! Spain,&mdash;there is no
country like it in the world! You must go to Spain,
Mr. Andersen. You would go there in a different spirit
from these wretched sight-seers who carry their own
vulgarity with them. You would go with that feeling
of reverence for the great things of civilization, which
is inseparable from the least drop of Latin blood.”</p>

<p>“Would <em>you</em> like to see Spain, Miss Traffio?” enquired
Vennie. “Mr. Taxater, I notice, always leaves
out us women, when he makes his attractive proposals.
I think he thinks that we have no capacity
for understanding this civilization he talks of.”</p>

<p>“I think you understand everything, better than
any man could,” murmured Lacrima, conscious of an
extraordinary depth of sympathy emanating from
this frail figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Seldom has been trying to make me appreciate
the beauty of these orchards,” went on Mr.
Taxater, addressing James. “But I am afraid I am
not very easily converted. I have a prejudice against
orchards. For some reason or other, I associate
them with dragons and serpents.”</p>

<p>“Miss Seldom has every reason to love the beautiful
aspects of our Nevilton scenery,” said the stone-carver.
“Her ancestors possessed all these fields and
orchards so long, that it would be strange if their
descendant did not have an instinctive passion for
them.” He uttered these words with that curious
undertone of bitterness which marked all his references
to aristocratic pretension.</p>

<p>Little Vennie brushed the sarcasm gently aside, as
if it had been a fluttering moth.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do love them in a sense,” she said, “but
you must remember that I, too, was educated in a
Latin country. So, you see, we four are all outsiders
and heretics! I fancy your brother, Mr. Andersen, is
an ingrained Neviltonian.”</p>

<p>James smiled in a kindly, almost paternal manner,
at the little descendant of the Tudor courtiers. Her
sweetness and artless goodness made him feel ashamed
of his furtive truculence.</p>

<p>“I wish you would come in and see my mother and
me, one of these evenings,” said Vennie, looking
rather wistfully at Lacrima and putting a more tender
solicitation into her tone than the mere words implied.</p>

<p>Lacrima hesitated. “I am afraid I cannot promise,”
she said nervously. “My cousin generally wants me
in the evening.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” put in Mr. Taxater, with his most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Talleyrand-like air, “a similar occasion to the present
one may arise again, when with Mr. Andersen’s permission,
we may all adjourn to the vicarage garden.”</p>

<p>Lacrima, rather uncomfortably, looked down at the
grass.</p>

<p>“We four, being, as we have admitted, all outsiders
here,” went on the diplomatist, “ought to have no
secrets from one another. I think”&mdash;he looked at
Vennie&mdash;“we may just as well confess to our friends
that we quite realize the little&mdash;charming&mdash;‘friendship,’
shall I say?&mdash;that has sprung up between this
gentleman’s brother and Miss Romer.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said James Andersen hurriedly, in order
to relieve Lacrima’s embarrassment, “I think the
real bond between Luke and Miss Gladys is their
mutual pleasure in all this luxuriant scenery. Somehow
I feel as if you, Sir, and Miss Seldom, were quite
separate from it and outside it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Vennie eagerly, “and Lacrima is
outside it, because she is half-Italian, and you are
outside it because you are half-Spanish.”</p>

<p>“It is clear, then,” said Mr. Taxater, “that we
four must form a sort of secret alliance, an alliance
based upon the fact that even Miss Seldom’s lovely
orchards do not altogether make us forget what
civilization means!”</p>

<p>Neither of the two girls seemed quite to understand
what the theologian implied, but Andersen shot at
him a gleam of appreciative gratitude.</p>

<p>“I was telling Miss Traffio,” he said, “that under
this grass, not very many feet down, a remarkable
layer of sandstone obtrudes itself.”</p>

<p>“An orchard based on rock,” murmured Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Taxater, “that, I think, is an admirable symbol of
what this place represents. Clay at the top and
sandstone at the bottom! I wonder whether it is
better, in this world, to be clay or stone? We four
poor foreigners have, I suspect, a preference for a
material very different from both of these. Our
element would be marble. Eh, Andersen? Marble
that can resist all these corrupting natural forces and
throw them back, and hold them down. I always
think that marble is the appropriate medium of
civilization’s retort to instinct and savagery. The
Latin races have always built in marble. It was
certainly of marble that our Lord was thinking when
he used his celebrated metaphor about the founding
of the Church.”</p>

<p>The stone-carver made no answer. He had noticed
a quick supplicating glance from Lacrima’s dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Well,”&mdash;he said, “I think I must be looking for
my brother, and I expect our young lady is waiting
for Miss Traffio.”</p>

<p>They bade their friends good-night and moved off.</p>

<p>“I am always at your service,” were Mr. Taxater’s
last words, “if ever either of you care to appeal to
the free-masonry of the children of marble against
the children of clay.”</p>

<p>As they retraced their steps Andersen remarked to
his companion how curious it was, that neither Vennie
nor Mr. Taxater seemed in the least aware of anything
extraordinary or unconventional in this surreptitious
friendship between the girls from the House
and their father’s workmen.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wonder what Mrs. Seldom would think of
us,” rejoined Lacrima, “but she probably thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Gladys is capable of anything and that I am as bad
as she is. But I do like that little Vennie! I believe
she is a real saint. She gives me such a queer feeling
of being different from everyone.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Taxater no doubt is making a convert of
her,” said the stone-carver. “And I have a suspicion
that he hopes to convert Gladys too, probably through
your influence.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to think that of him,” replied the
girl. “He seems to me to admire Vennie for herself
and to be kind to us for ourselves. I think he is a
thoroughly good man.”</p>

<p>“Possibly&mdash;possibly,” muttered James, “but I
don’t trust him. I never have trusted him.”</p>

<p>They said no more, and threaded their way slowly
through the orchard to the place where they had
left the others. The wind had dropped and there was
a dull, obstinate expectancy in the atmosphere.
Every leaf and grass blade seemed to be intently
alert and listening.</p>

<p>In her heart Lacrima was conscious of an unusual
sense of foreboding and apprehension. Surely there
could be nothing worse in store for her than what
she already suffered. She wondered what Maurice
Quincunx was doing at that moment. Was he thinking
of her, and were his thoughts the cause of this
strange oppression in the air? Poor Maurice! She
longed to be free to devote herself to him, to smooth
his path, to distract his mind. Would fate ever
make such a thing possible? How unfair Gladys was
in her suspicions!</p>

<p>She liked James Andersen and was very grateful to
him, but he did not need her as Maurice needed her!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see them!” she cried suddenly. “But how odd
they look! They’re not speaking a word. Have
they quarrelled, I wonder?”</p>

<p>The two fair-haired amorists appeared indeed
extremely gloomy and melancholy, as they sat, with
a little space between them, on the fallen tree. They
rose with an air of relief at the others’ approach.</p>

<p>“I thought you were never coming,” said Gladys.
“How long you have been! We have been waiting
for hours. Come along. We must go straight back
and dress or we shall be late for dinner. No time
for good-byes! Au revoir, you two! Come along,
girl, quick! We’d better run.”</p>

<p>She seized her cousin’s hand and dragged her off
and they were quickly out of sight.</p>

<p>The two brothers watched them disappear and
then turned and walked away together. “Don’t
let’s go home yet,” said Luke. “Let’s go to the
churchyard first. The sun will have set, but it won’t
be dark for a long time. And I love the churchyard
in the twilight.”</p>

<p>James nodded. “It is our garden, isn’t it,&mdash;and
our orchard? It is the only spot in Nevilton where
no one can interfere with us.”</p>

<p>“That, and the Seldom Arms,” added the younger
brother.</p>

<p>They paced side by side in silence till they reached
the road. The orchards, left to themselves, relapsed
into their accustomed reserve. Whatever secrets
they concealed of the confused struggles of ephemeral
mortals, they concealed in inviolable discretion.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">ART AND NATURE</span></h2>

<p>The early days of June, all of them of the same
quality of golden weather, were hardly over,
before our wanderer from Ohio found himself
on terms of quite pleasant familiarity with the
celibate vicar of Nevilton, whose relations with his
friend Gladys so immensely interested him.</p>

<p>The conscientious vicar had sought him out, on
the very day after his visit to the mill copse and
the artist had found the priest more to his fancy
than he had imagined possible.</p>

<p>The American’s painting had begun in serious
earnest. A studio had been constructed for him in
one of the sheds near the conservatory, a place much
more full of light and air and pleasant garden smells,
than would have been the lumber-room referred to by
Mrs. Romer, adjoining the chaste slumbers of the
laborious Lily. Here for several long mornings he
had worked at high pressure and in a vein of imaginative
expansion.</p>

<p>Something of the seething sap of these incomparable
days seemed to pass into his blood. He plunged into
a bold and original series of Dionysic “impressions,”
seeking to represent, in accordance with his new vision,
those legendary episodes in the life of the divine
Wanderer which seemed most capable of lending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
themselves to a half-realistic, half-fantastic transmutation,
of the people and places immediately
around him. He sought to introduce into these
pictures the very impetus and pressure of the exuberant
earth-force, as he felt it stirring and fermenting
in his own veins, and in those of the persons and
animals about him. He strove to clothe the shadowy
poetic outline of the classical story with fragments
and morsels of actual experience as one by one his
imaginative intellect absorbed them.</p>

<p>Here, too, under the sycamores and elms of Nevilton,
the old world-madness followed the alternations
of sun and moon, with the same tragic swiftness and
the same ambiguous beauty, as when, with tossing
arms and bared throats, the virgins of Thessaly flung
themselves into the dew-starred thickets.</p>

<p>Dangelis began by making cautious and tentative
use of such village children as he found it possible
to lay hands upon, as models in his work, but this
method did not prove very satisfactory.</p>

<p>The children, when their alarm and inquisitiveness
wore off, grew tired and turbulent; and on more than
one occasion the artist had to submit to astonishing
visits from confused and angry parents who
called him a “foreigner” and a “Yankee,” and
qualified these appellations with epithets so astoundingly
gross, that Dangelis was driven to wonder
from what simple city-bred fancy the illusion of rural
innocence had first proceeded.</p>

<p>At length, as the days went on, the bold idea
came into his head of persuading Gladys herself to
act as his model.</p>

<p>His relations with her had firmly established themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
now on the secure ground of playful camaraderie,
and he knew enough of her to feel tolerably
certain that he had only to broach such a scheme,
to have it welcomed with enthusiastic ardour.</p>

<p>He made the suggestion one evening as they walked
home together after her spiritual lesson. “I find
that last picture of mine extremely difficult to manage,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Why! I think it’s the best of them all!” cried
Gladys. “You’ve got a lovely look of longing in the
eyes of your queer god; and the sail of Theseus’ ship,
as you see it against the blue sea, is wonderful. The
little bushes and things, too, you’ve put in; I like
them particularly. They remind me of that wood
down by the mill, where I caught the thrush. I
suppose you’ve forgotten all about that day,” she
added, giving him a quick sidelong glance.</p>

<p>The artist seized his opportunity. “They would
remind you still more of our wood,” he said eagerly,
“if you let me put you in as Ariadne! Do, Gladys,”&mdash;he
had called her Gladys for some days&mdash;“you
will make a simply adorable Ariadne. As she is
now, she is wooden, grotesque, archaic&mdash;nothing
but drapery and white ankles!”</p>

<p>The girl had flushed with pleasure as soon as she
caught the drift of his request. Now she glanced
mischievously and mockingly at him.</p>

<p>“<em>My</em> ankles,” she murmured laughing, “are not
so very, very beautiful!”</p>

<p>“Please be serious, Gladys,” he said, “I am really
quite in earnest. It will just make the difference
between a masterpiece and a fiasco.”</p>

<p>“You are very conceited,” she retorted teasingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
“but I suppose I oughtn’t to say that, ought I, as
my precious ankles are to be a part of this masterpiece?”</p>

<p>She ran in front of him down the drive, and, as
if to give him an exhibition of her goddess-like agility,
caught at an overhanging bough and swung herself
backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>“What fun!” she cried, as he approached. “Of
course I’ll do it, Mr. Dangelis.” Then, with a sudden
change of tone and a very malign expression, as she
let the branch swing back and resumed her place at
his side, “Mr. Clavering must see me posing for you.
He must say whether he thinks I’m good enough
for Ariadne.”</p>

<p>The artist looked a shade disconcerted by this
unexpected turn to the project, but he was too anxious
to make sure of his model to raise any premature
objections. “But you must please understand,” was
all he said, “that I am very much in earnest about
this picture. If anybody but myself <em>does</em> see you,
there must be no teasing and fooling.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I long for him to see me!” cried the girl.
“I can just imagine his face, I can just imagine it!”</p>

<p>The artist frowned. “This is not a joke, Gladys.
Mind you, if I do let Clavering into our secret, it’ll
be only on condition that you promise not to flirt
with him. I shall want you to stay very still,&mdash;just
as I put you.”</p>

<p>Dangelis had never indicated before quite so plainly
his blunt and unvarnished view of her relations with
her spiritual adviser, and he now looked rather nervously
at her to see how she received this intimation.</p>

<p>“I <em>love</em> teasing Mr. Clavering!” she cried savagely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
“I should like to tease him so much, that he never,
never, would forget it!”</p>

<p>This extreme expression of feeling was a surprise,
and by no means a pleasant one, to Ralph Dangelis.</p>

<p>“Why do you want so much to upset our friend?”
he enquired.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” she answered, still instinctively playing
up to his idea of her naiveté and childishness,
“it is because he thinks himself so good and so perfectly
safe from falling in love with anyone&mdash;and
that annoys me.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” chuckled Dangelis, “so that’s it, is it?”
and he paced in thoughtful silence by her side until
they reached the house.</p>

<p>The morning that followed this conversation was
as warm as the preceding ones, but a strong southern
wind had risen, with a remote touch of the sea in its
gusty violence. The trees in the park, as the artist
and his girl-friend watched them from the terrace,
while Mr. Romer, who had now returned from town
worked in his study, and Lacrima helped Mrs. Romer
to “do the flowers,” swayed and rustled ominously in
the eddying gusts.</p>

<p>Clouds of dust kept blowing across the gates from
the surface of the drive and the delphiniums bent
low on their long stalks. The wind was of that peculiar
character which, though hot and full of balmy
scents, conveys a feeling of uneasiness and troubled
expectation. It suggested thunder and with and beyond
that, something threatening, calamitous and
fatal.</p>

<p>Gladys was preoccupied and gloomy that morning.
She was growing a little, just a little, tired of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the American’s conversation. Even the excitement
of arranging about the purchase in Yeoborough of
suitable materials for her Ariadne costume did not
serve to lift the shadow from her brow.</p>

<p>She was getting tired of her rôle as the naive, impetuous
and childish innocent; and though mentally
still quite resolved upon following her mother’s frequent
and unblushing hints, and doing her best to
“catch” this æsthetic master of a million dollars, the
burden of the task was proving considerably irksome.</p>

<p>Ralph’s growing tendency to take her into his
confidence in the matter of the philosophy of his
art, she found peculiarly annoying.</p>

<p>Philosophy of any kind was detestable to Gladys,
and this particular sort of philosophy especially depressed
her, by reducing the attraction of physical
beauty to a kind of dispassionate analysis, against
the chilling virtue of which all her amorous wiles
hopelessly collapsed. It was becoming increasingly
difficult, too, to secure her furtive interviews with
Luke&mdash;interviews in which her cynical sensuality,
suppressed in the society of the American, was allowed
full swing.</p>

<p>Her thoughts, at this very moment, turned passionately
and vehemently towards the young stone-carver,
who had achieved, at last, the enviable triumph of
seriously ruffling and disturbing her egoistic self-reliance.</p>

<p>Unused to suffering the least thwarting in what she
desired, it fretted and chafed her intolerably to be
forced to go on playing her coquettish part with this
good-natured but inaccessible admirer, while all the
time her soul yearned so desperately for the shameless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
kisses that made her forget everything in the
world but the ecstacy of passion.</p>

<p>It was all very well to plan this posing as Ariadne
and to listen to Dangelis discoursing on the beauty
of pagan myths. The artist might talk endlessly
about dryads and fauns. The faun she longed
to be pursued by, this wind-swept morning, was now
engaged in hammering Leonian stone, in her father’s
dusty work-shops.</p>

<p>She knew, she told herself, far better than the
cleverest citizen of Ohio, what a real Greek god was
like, both in his kindness and his unkindness; and her
nerves quivered with irritation, as the hot southern
wind blew upon her, to think that she would only
be able, and even then for a miserably few minutes,
to steal off to her true Dionysus, after submitting
for a whole long day to this æsthetic foolery.</p>

<p>“It must have been a wind like this,” remarked
Dangelis, quite unobservant of his companion’s moroseness,
“which rocked the doomed palace of the blaspheming
Pentheus and drove him forth to his fate.”
He paused a moment, pondering, and then added, “I
shall paint a picture of this, Gladys. I shall bring
in Tiresias and the other old men, feeling the madness
coming upon them.”</p>

<p>“I know all about that,” the girl felt compelled to
answer. “They danced, didn’t they? They couldn’t help
dancing, though they were so old and weak?”</p>

<p>Dangelis hardly required this encouragement, to
launch into a long discourse upon the subject of
Dionysian madness, its true symbolic meaning, its
religious significance, its survival in modern times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>He quite forgot, as he gave himself up to this
interesting topic, his recent resolution to exclude drastically
from his work all these more definitely intellectualized
symbols.</p>

<p>His companion’s answers to this harangue became,
by degrees, so obviously forced and perfunctory, that
even the good-tempered westerner found himself a
little relieved when the appearance of Lacrima upon
the scene gave him a different audience.</p>

<p>When Lacrima appeared, Gladys slipped away and
Dangelis was left to do what he could to overcome the
Italian’s habitual shyness.</p>

<p>“One of these days,” he said, looking with a kindly
smile into the girl’s frightened eyes, “I’m going to
ask you, Miss Traffio, to take me to see your friend
Mr. Quincunx.”</p>

<p>Lacrima started violently. This was the last name
she expected to hear mentioned on the Nevilton
terrace.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;” she stammered, “I should be very
glad to take you. I didn’t know they had told you
about him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they only told me&mdash;you can guess the kind of
thing!&mdash;that he’s a queer fellow who lives by himself
in a cottage in Dead Man’s Lane, and does
nothing but dig in his garden and talk to old women
over the wall. He’s evidently one of these odd out-of-the-way
characters, that your English&mdash;Oh, I beg
your pardon!&mdash;your European villages produce. Mr.
Clavering told me he is the only man in the place
he never goes to see. Apparently he once insulted
the good vicar.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t insult him!” cried Lacrima with flashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
eyes. “He only asked him not to walk on his potatoes.
Mr. Clavering is too touchy.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;anyway, do take me, sometime, to see
this interesting person. Why shouldn’t we go this
afternoon? This wind seems to have driven all the
ideas out of my head, as well as made your cousin
extremely bad-tempered! So do take me to see your
friend, Miss Traffio! We might go now&mdash;this
moment&mdash;why not?”</p>

<p>Lacrima shook her head, but she looked grateful
and not displeased. As a matter of fact she was
particularly anxious to introduce the American to
Mr. Quincunx. In that vague subtle way which is
a peculiarity, not only of the Pariah-type, but of
human nature in general, she was anxious that
Dangelis should be given at least a passing glimpse
of another view of the Romer family from that which
he seemed to have imbibed.</p>

<p>It was not that she was definitely plotting against
her cousin or trying to undermine her position with
her artist-friend, but she felt a natural human desire
that this sympathetic and good-tempered man should
be put, to some extent at least, upon his guard.</p>

<p>She was, at any rate, not at all unwilling to initiate
him into the mysteries of Mr. Quincunx’ mind, hoping,
perhaps, in an obscure sort of way, that such an
initiation would throw her own position, in this
strange household, into a light more evocative of
considerate interest.</p>

<p>She had been so often made conscious of late that
in his absorption in Gladys he had swept her brusquely
aside as a dull and tiresome spoil-sport, that it was
not without a certain feminine eagerness that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
embraced the thought of his being compelled to
listen to what she well knew Mr. Quincunx would
have to say upon the matter.</p>

<p>It was also an agreeable thought that in doing
justice to the originality and depth of the recluse’s
intelligence, the American would be driven to recognize
the essentially unintellectual tone of conversation
at Nevilton House.</p>

<p>She instinctively felt sure that the same generous
and comprehensive sympathy that led him to condone
the vulgar lapses of these “new people,” would
lead him to embrace with more than toleration the
eccentricities and aberration of the forlorn relative
of the Lords of Glastonbury.</p>

<p>With these thoughts passing rapidly through her
brain, Lacrima found herself, after a little further
hesitation, agreeing demurely to the American’s proposal
to visit the tenant of Dead Man’s Lane before
the end of the day. She left it uncertain at what
precise hour they should go&mdash;probably between tea
and dinner&mdash;because she was anxious, for her own
sake, dreading her cousin’s anger, to make the adventure
synchronize, if possible, with the latter’s assignation
with Luke, trusting that the good turn she thus did
her, by removing her artistic admirer at a critical juncture,
would propitiate the fair-haired tyrant’s wrath.</p>

<p>This matter having been satisfactorily settled, the
Italian began to feel, as she observed the artist’s bold
and challenging glance embracing her from head to
foot, while he continued to this new and more attentive
listener his interrupted monologue, that species
of shy and nervous restraint which invariably embarrassed
her when left alone in his society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Inexperienced at detecting the difference between
æsthetic interest and emotional interest, and associating
the latter with nothing but what was brutal
and gross, Lacrima experienced a disconcerting sort
of shame when under the scrutiny of his eyes.</p>

<p>Her timid comments upon his observations showed,
however, so much more subtle insight into his meaning
than Gladys had ever displayed, that it was with
a genuine sense of regret that he accepted at last
some trifling excuse she offered and let her wander
away. Feeling restless and in need of distraction he
returned to the house and sought the society of
Mrs. Romer.</p>

<p>He discovered this good lady seated in the housekeeper’s
room, perusing an illustrated paper and
commenting upon its contents to the portly Mrs.
Murphy. The latter discreetly withdrew on the
appearance of the guest of the house, and Dangelis
entered into conversation with his hostess.</p>

<p>“Maurice Quincunx!” she cried, as soon as her
visitor mentioned the recluse’s queer name, “you
don’t mean to say that Lacrima’s going to take you
to see <em>him</em>? Well&mdash;of all the nonsensical ideas I
ever heard! You’d better not tell Mortimer where
you’re going. He’s just now very angry with
Maurice. It won’t please him at all, her taking you
there. Maurice is related to me, you know, not to
Mr. Romer. Mr. Romer has never liked him, and
lately&mdash;but there! I needn’t go into all that.
We used to see quite a lot of him in the old days,
when we first came to Nevilton. I like to have someone
about, you know, and Maurice was somebody
to talk to, when Mr. Romer was away; but lately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
things have been quite different. It is all very sad and
very tiresome, you know, but what can a person do?”</p>

<p>This was the nearest approach to a hint of divergence
between the master and mistress of Nevilton
that Dangelis had ever been witness to, and even
this may have been misleading, for the shrewd little
eyes, out of which the lady peered at him, over her
spectacles, were more expressive of mild malignity
than of moral indignation.</p>

<p>“But what kind of person is this Mr. Quincunx?”
enquired the American. “I confess I can’t, so far,
get any clear vision of his personality. Won’t you
tell me something more definite about him, something
that will ‘give me a line on him,’ as we say
in the States?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romer looked a trifle bewildered. It seemed
that the personality of Mr. Quincunx was not a topic
that excited her conversational powers.</p>

<p>“I never really cared for him,” she finally remarked.
“He used to talk so unnaturally. He’d come over
here, you know, almost every day&mdash;when Gladys
was a little girl,&mdash;and talk and talk and talk. I
used to think sometimes he wasn’t quite right here,”&mdash;the
good lady tapped her forehead with her fore-finger,&mdash;“but
in some things he was very sensible.
I don’t mean that he spoke loud or shouted or was
noisy. Sometimes he didn’t say very much; but
even when he didn’t speak, his listening was like
talking. Gladys used to be quite fond of him when
she was a little girl. He used to play hide-and-seek
with her in the garden. I think he helped me to
keep her out of mischief more than any of her governesses
did. Once, you know, he beat Tom Raggles&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
miller’s son&mdash;because he followed her across
the park&mdash;beat him over the head, they say, with
an iron pick. The lying wretch of a lad swore that
she had encouraged him, and we were driven to hush
the matter up, but I believe Mr. Quincunx had to
see the inspector in Yeoborough.”</p>

<p>Beyond this somewhat obscure incident, Dangelis
found it impossible to draw from Mrs. Romer any
intelligible answer to his questions. The figure of
the evasive tenant of the cottage in Dead Man’s
Lane remained as misty as ever.</p>

<p>A little irritated by the ill success of his psychological
investigations, the artist, conscious that he
was wasting the morning, began, out of sheer capricious
wilfulness, to expound his æsthetic ideas to
this third interlocutor.</p>

<p>His nerves were in a morbid and unbalanced state,
due partly to a lapse in his creative energy, and partly
to the fact that in the depths of his mind he was
engaged in a half-conscious struggle to suppress and
keep in its proper place the insidious physical attraction
which Gladys had already begun to exert upon
him.</p>

<p>But the destiny of poor Dangelis, this inauspicious
morning, was, it seemed, to become a bore and
a pedant to everyone he encountered; for the lady
had hardly listened for two minutes to his discourse
when she also left him, with some suitable apology,
and went off to perform more practical household
duties. “What did this worthy Quincunx talk about,
that you used to find so tiresome?” the artist flung
after her, as she left the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romer turned on the threshold. “He talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of nothing but the bible,” she said. “The bible and
our blessed Lord. You can’t blame me, Mr. Dangelis,
for objecting to that sort of thing, can you?
I call it blasphemy, nothing short of blasphemy!”</p>

<p>Dangelis wondered, as he strolled out again into
the air, intending to seek solace for his irritable
nerves in a solitary walk, whether, if it were blasphemy
in Nevilton House to refer to the Redeemer
of men, and a nuisance and a bore to refer to heathen
idolatries, what kind of topic it might be that the
place’s mental atmosphere demanded.</p>

<p>He came to the conclusion, as he proceeded down
the west drive, that the Romer family was more
stimulating to watch, than edifying to converse with.</p>

<p>After tea that evening, as Lacrima had hoped,
Gladys announced her intention of going down to
the mill to sketch. This&mdash;to Lacrima’s initiated
ears&mdash;meant an assignation with Luke, and she
glanced quickly at Dangelis, with a shy smile, to
indicate that their projected visit was possible. As
soon as her cousin had departed they set out. Their
expedition seemed likely to prove a complete success.
They found Mr. Quincunx in one of his gayest moods.
Had he been expecting the appearance of the American
he would probably have worked himself up into
a miserable state of nervous apprehension; but the
introduction thus suddenly thrust upon him, the
genial simplicity of the Westerner’s manners and his
honest openness of speech disarmed him completely.
In a mood of this kind the recluse became a charming
companion.</p>

<p>Dangelis was immensely delighted with him. His
original remarks, and the quaint chuckling bursts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
sardonic laughter which accompanied his irresistible
sallies, struck the artist as something completely
different from what he had expected. He had
looked to see a listless preoccupied mystic, ready to
flood him with dreamy and wearisome monologues
upon “the simple life,” and in place of this he found
an entertaining and gracious gentleman, full of delicious
malice, and uttering quip after quip of sly,
half-innocent, half-subtle, Rabelaisean humour, in the
most natural manner in the world.</p>

<p>Not quite able to bring his affability to the point
of inviting them into his kitchen, Mr. Quincunx carried
out, into a sheltered corner, three rickety chairs
and a small deal table. Here, protected from the
gusty wind, he offered them cups of exquisitely prepared
cocoa and little oatmeal biscuits. He asked
the American question after question about his
life in the remote continent, putting into his enquiries
such naive and childlike eagerness, that
Dangelis congratulated himself upon having at last
discovered an Englishman who was not superior to
the charming vice of curiosity. Had the artist possessed
less of that large and careless aplomb which
makes the utmost of every situation and never teases
itself with criticism, he might have regarded the
recluse’s effusiveness as too deprecatory and propitiatory
in its tone. This, however, never occurred
to him and he swallowed the solitary’s flattery with
joy and gratitude, especially as it followed so quickly
upon the conversational deficiencies of Nevilton
House.</p>

<p>“I live in the mud here,” said Mr. Quincunx, “and
that makes it so excellent of you two people from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the upper world to slip down into the mud with
me.”</p>

<p>“I think you live very happily and very sensibly,
Maurice!” cried Lacrima, looking with tender affection
upon her friend. “I wish we could all live as you
do.”</p>

<p>The recluse waved his hand. “There must be
lions and antelopes in the world,” he said, “as well
as frogs and toads. I expect this friend of yours,
who has seen the great cities, is at this moment
wishing he were in a café in New York or Paris,
rather than sitting on a shaky chair drinking my bad
cocoa.”</p>

<p>“That’s not very complimentary to me, is it, Mr.
Dangelis?” said Lacrima.</p>

<p>“Mr. Quincunx is much to be envied,” remarked
the American. “He is living the sort of life that
every man of sense would wish to live. It’s outrageous,
the way we let ourselves become slave to
objects and circumstances and people.”</p>

<p>Lacrima, anxious in the depths of her heart to
give the American the benefit of Mr. Quincunx’s
insight into character, turned the conversation in
the direction of the rumored political contest between
Romer and Wone. She was not quite pleased
with the result of this manœuvre, however, as it at
once diminished the solitary’s high spirits and led
to his adoption of the familiar querulous tone of
peevish carping.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx spoke of his remoteness from the
life around him. He referred with bitter sarcasm
to the obsequious worship of power from which every
inhabitant of the village of Nevilton suffered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“I laugh,” he said, “when our good socialist Wone
gives vent to his eloquent protestations. Really,
in his heart, he is liable to just the same cringing
to power as all the rest. Let Romer make overtures
to him,&mdash;only he despises him too much to do that,&mdash;and
you’d soon see how quickly he’d swing round!
Give him a position of power, Dangelis&mdash;I expect
you know from your experience in your own country
how this works out,&mdash;and you would soon find him
just as tyrannical, just as obdurate.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re quite wrong, Maurice,” cried
Lacrima impetuously. “Mr. Wone is not an educated
man as you are, but he’s entirely sincere. You’ve
only to listen to him to understand his sincerity.”</p>

<p>A grievous shadow of irritation and pique crossed
the recluse’s face. Nothing annoyed him more than
this kind of direct opposition. He waved the objection
aside. Lacrima’s outburst of honest feeling had
already undone the subtle purpose with which she
had brought the American. Her evasive Balaam
was, it appeared, inclined, out of pure wilfulness, to
bless rather than curse their grand enemy.</p>

<p>“It’s all injured vanity,” Mr. Quincunx went on,
throwing at his luckless girl-friend a look of quite
disproportioned anger. “It’s all his outraged power-instinct
that drives him to take up this pose. I know
what I’m talking about, for I often argue with him.
Whenever I dispute the smallest point of his theories,
he bursts out like a demon and despises me as a
downright fool. He’d have got me turned out of
the Social Meetings, because I contradicted him there,
if our worthy clergyman hadn’t intervened. You’ve
no idea how deep this power-instinct goes. You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
remember, Mr. Dangelis, you see a village like ours
entirely from the outside and you think it beautiful,
and the people charming and gentle. I tell you it’s a
nest of rattlesnakes! It’s a narrow, poisonous cage,
full of deadly vindictiveness and concentrated malice.
Of course we know what human nature is, wherever
you find it, but if you want to find it at its very worst,
come to Nevilton!”</p>

<p>“But you yourself,” protested the artist, “are you
not one of these same people? I understand that
you&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx rose to his feet, his expressive nostrils
quivering with anger. “I don’t allow anyone to say
that of me!” he cried “I may have my faults, but I’m
as different from all these rats, as a guillemot is different
from a cormorant!”</p>

<p>He sat down again and his voice took almost a
pleading tone. “You know I’m different. You must
know I’m different! How could I see all these things
as clearly as I do if it wasn’t so? I’ve undergone
what that German calls ‘the Great Renunciation.’
I’ve escaped the will to live. I neither care to acquire
myself this accursed power&mdash;or to revolt, in jealous
envy, against those who possess it.”</p>

<p>He relapsed into silence and contemplated his
garden and its enclosing hedge, with a look of profound
melancholy. Dangelis had been considerably
distracted during the latter part of this discourse by
his artistic interest in the delicate lines of Lacrima’s
figure and the wistful sadness of her expression. It
was borne in upon him that he had somewhat neglected
this shy cousin of his exuberant young friend.
He promised himself to see more of the Italian, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
occasion served. Perhaps&mdash;if only Gladys would
agree to it&mdash;he might make use of her, also, in his
Dionysian impressions.</p>

<p>“Surely,” he remarked, speaking with the surface
of his intelligence, and pondering all the while upon
the secret of Lacrima’s charm, “whatever this man
may be, he’s not a hypocrite,&mdash;is he? From all I
hear he’s pathetically in earnest.”</p>

<p>“Of course we know he’s in earnest,” answered
Maurice. “What I maintain is, that it is his personal
vindictiveness that creates his opinions. I believe
he would derive genuine pleasure from seeing Nevilton
House burnt to the ground, and every one of the
people in it reduced to ashes!”</p>

<p>“That proves his sincerity,” answered the American,
keeping his gaze fixed so intently upon Lacrima
that the girl began to be embarrassed.</p>

<p>“He takes the view-point, no doubt, that if the
present oligarchy in England were entirely destroyed,
a new and happier epoch would begin at once.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure Mr. Wone is opposed to every kind of
violence,” threw in Lacrima.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” cried Mr. Quincunx abruptly. “He
may not like violence because he’s afraid of it reacting
on himself. But what he wants to do is to humiliate
everyone above him, to disturb them, to
prod them, to harass and distress them, and if
possible to bring them down to his own level. He’s
got his thumb on Lacrima’s friends over there,”&mdash;he
waved his hand in the direction of Nevilton
House,&mdash;“because they happen to be at the
top of the tree at this moment. But if you or I
were there, it would be just the same. It’s all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
jealousy. That’s what it is,&mdash;jealousy and envy!
He wants to make every one who’s prosperous and
eats meat, and drinks champagne, know what it is
to live a dog’s life, as he has known it himself! I
understand his feelings very well. We poor toads, who
live in the mud, get extraordinary pleasure when any
of you grand gentlemen slip by accident into our
dirty pond. He sees such people enjoying themselves
and being happy and he wants to stick a few pins
into them!”</p>

<p>“But why not, my good sir?” answered the American.
“Why shouldn’t Wone use all his energy to
crush Romer, just as Romer uses all his energy to
crush Wone?”</p>

<p>Lacrima sighed. “I don’t think either of you make
this world seem a very nice place,” she observed.</p>

<p>“A nice place?” cried Mr. Quincunx. “It’s a
place poisoned at the root&mdash;a place full of gall and
wormwood!”</p>

<p>“In my humble opinion,” said the American, “it’s
a splendid world. I love to see these little struggles
and contests going on. I love to see the delicious
inconsistencies and self-deceptions that we’re all
guilty of. I play the game myself, and I love to
see others play it. It’s the only thing I do love,
except&mdash;” he added after a pause&mdash;“except my
pictures.”</p>

<p>“I loathe the game,” retorted the recluse, “and I
find it impossible to live with people who do not
loathe it too.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;all I can say, my friend,” observed Dangelis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
“is that this business of ‘renouncing,’ of which
you talk, doesn’t appeal to me. It strikes me as
a backing down and scurrying away, from the splendid
adventure of being alive at all. What are you
alive for,” he added, “if you are going to condemn
the natural combative instinct of men and women
as evil and horrible? They are the instincts by
which we live. They are the motives that propel the
whole universe.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wone would say,” interposed Lacrima, “and
I’m not sure that I don’t agree with him, that the
real secret of the universe is deeper than all these
unhappy struggles. I don’t like the unctuous way
he puts these things, but he may be right all the
same.”</p>

<p>“There’s no secret of the universe, Miss Traffio,”
the American threw in. “There are many things
we don’t understand. But no one principle,&mdash;not
even the principle of love itself, can be allowed to
monopolize the whole field. Life, I always feel, is
better interpreted by Art than by anything else, and
Art is equally interested in every kind of energy.”</p>

<p>Lacrima’s face clouded, and her hands fell wearily
upon her lap.</p>

<p>“Some sorts of energy,” she observed, in a low
voice, “are brutal and dreadful. If Art expresses that
kind, I’m afraid I don’t care for Art.”</p>

<p>The American gave her a quick, puzzled glance.
There was a sorrowful intensity about her tone which
he found difficult to understand.</p>

<p>“What I meant was,” he said, “that logically we
can only do one of two things,&mdash;either join in the
game and fight fiercely and craftily for our own hand,
or take a convenient drop of poison and end the whole
affair.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The melancholy eyes of Mr. Quincunx opened very
wide at this, and a fluttering smile twitched the corners
of his mouth.</p>

<p>“We poor dogs,” he said, “who are not wanted in
this world, and don’t believe in any other, are just
the people who are most unwilling to finish ourselves
off in the way you suggest. We can’t help a sort of
sneaking hope, that somehow or another, through
no effort of our own, things will become better for
us. The same cowardice that makes us draw back
from life, makes us draw back from the thought of
death. Can’t you understand that,&mdash;you American
citizen?”</p>

<p>Dangelis looked from one to another of his companions.
He could not help thinking in his heart of
the gay animated crowds, who, at that very moment,
in the streets of Toledo, Ohio, were pouring along
the side-walks and flooding the picture shows. These
quaint Europeans, for all their historic surroundings,
were certainly lacking in the joy of life.</p>

<p>“I can’t conceive,” remarked Mr. Quincunx suddenly,
and with that amazing candour which distinguished
him, “how a person as artistic and sensitive
as you are, can stay with those people over there.
Anyone can see that you’re as different from them as
light from darkness.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” replied the American, interrupting
a feeble little protest which Lacrima was beginning
to make at the indiscretion of her friend, “I may or
may not understand your wonder. The point is,
that my whole principle of life is to deal boldly and
freely with every kind of person. Can’t you see that
I like to look on at the spectacle of Mr. Romer’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
energy and prosperity, just as I like to look on at
the revolt against these things in the mind of our
friend Wone. I tell you it tickles my fancy to touch
this human pantomime on every possible side. The
more unjust Romer is towards Wone, the more I
am amused. And the more unjust Wone is towards
Romer, the more I am amused. It is out of the
clash of these opposite injustices that nature,&mdash;how
shall I put it?&mdash;that nature expands and grows.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx gazed at the utterer of these antinomian
sentiments, with humorous interest. Dangelis
gathered, from the twitching of his heavy moustache,
that he was chuckling like a goblin. The
queer fellow had a way of emerging out of his melancholy,
at certain moments, like a badger out of his
hole; and at such times he would bring the most ideal
or speculative conversation down with a jerk to the
very bed-rock of reality.</p>

<p>“What’s amusing you so?” enquired the citizen
of Ohio.</p>

<p>“I was only thinking,” chuckled Mr. Quincunx,
stroking his beard, and glancing sardonically at
Lacrima, “that the real reason of your enjoying
yourself at Nevilton House, is quite a different one
from any you have mentioned.”</p>

<p>Dangelis was for the moment quite confused. “Confound
the fellow!” he muttered to himself, “I’m
curst if I’m sorry he’s under the thumb of our friend
Romer!”</p>

<p>His equanimity was soon restored, however, and he
covered his confusion by assuming a light and flippant
air.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” he exclaimed, “so you’re thinking I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
been caught by this young lady’s cousin? Well!
I don’t mind confessing that we get on beautifully
together. But as for anything else, I think Miss
Traffio will bear witness that I am quite as devoted
to the mother as the daughter. But Gladys Romer
must be admitted a very attractive girl,&mdash;mustn’t she
Miss Traffio? I suppose our friend here is not so
stern an ascetic as to refuse an artist like me the
pleasure of admiring such adorable suppleness as
your cousin possesses; such a&mdash;such a&mdash;” he waved
his hand vaguely in the air, “such a free and flexible
sort of grace?”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx picked up a rough ash stick which
lay on the ground and prodded the earth. His face
showed signs of growing once more convulsed with
indecent merriment.</p>

<p>“Why do you use all those long words?” he said.
“We country dogs go more straight to the point in
these matters. Flexible grace! Can’t you confess
that you’re bitten by the old Satan, which we all
have in us? Adorable suppleness! Why can’t you
say a buxom wench, a roguish wench, a playful
wanton wench? We country fellows don’t understand
your subtle artistic expressions. But we know
what it is when an honest foreigner like yourself
goes walking and talking with a person like Madame
Gladys!”</p>

<p>Glancing apprehensively at the American’s face
Lacrima saw that her friend’s rudeness had made
him, this time, seriously angry.</p>

<p>She rose from her chair. “We must be getting
back,” she said, “or we shall be late. I hope you and
Mr. Dangelis will know more of one another, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
he has to leave Nevilton. I’m sure you’ll find that
you’ve quite a lot in common, when you really
begin to understand each other.”</p>

<p>The gravity and earnestness with which she uttered
these words made both her companions feel a little
ashamed.</p>

<p>“After all,” thought the artist, “he is a typical
Englishman.”</p>

<p>“After all,” thought Mr. Quincunx, “I’ve always
been told that Americans treat women as if they were
made of tissue-paper.”</p>

<p>Their parting from the recluse at his garden gate
was friendly and natural. Mr. Quincunx reverted
to his politest manner, and the artist’s good temper
seemed quite restored.</p>

<p>In retrospect, after the passing of a couple of days,
spent by Dangelis in preparing the accessories of his
Ariadne picture, and by Gladys in unpacking certain
mysterious parcels telegraphed for to London, the
American found himself recalling his visit to Dead
Man’s Cottage with none but amiable feelings. The
third morning which followed this visit, dawned
upon Nevilton with peculiar propitiousness. The
air was windless and full of delicious fragrance. The
bright clear sunshine seemed to penetrate every portion
of the spacious Elizabethan mansion and to
turn its corridors and halls, filled with freshly plucked
flowers, into a sort of colossal garden house.</p>

<p>Dangelis rose that morning with a more than
normal desire to plunge into his work. He was considerably
annoyed, however, to find that Gladys had
actually arranged to have Mr. Clavering invited to
lunch and had gone so far as to add a pencilled scrawl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of her own&mdash;she herself laughingly confessed as
much&mdash;to her mother’s formal note, begging him to
appear in the middle of the forenoon, as she had a
“surprise” in store for him.</p>

<p>The American’s anxiety to begin work as soon as
possible with his attractive model, made him suffer
miseries of impatience, while Gladys amused herself
with her Ariadne draperies, making Lacrima dress
and undress her twenty times, behind the screens of
the studio.</p>

<p>She appeared at last, however, and the artist,
looking up at her from his canvas, was for the
moment staggered by her beauty. The instinctive
taste of her cousin’s Latin fingers was shown in the
exquisite skill with which the classical folds of the
dress she wore accentuated the natural charm of her
young form.</p>

<p>The stuff of which her chief garment was made
was of a deep gentian blue and the contrast between
this color and the dazzling whiteness of her neck and
arms was enough to ravish not only the æsthetic
soul in the man but his more human senses also.
Her bare feet were encased in white sandals, bound
by slender leathern straps, which were twisted round
her legs almost as high as the knee. A thin metal
band, of burnished bronze, was clasped about her
head and over and under this, her magnificent sun-coloured
hair flowed, in easy and natural waves, to
where it was caught up, in a Grecian knot, above the
nape of her neck. Save for this band round her head
she wore no clasps or jewelry of any kind, and the
softness of her flesh was made more emphatic by
the somewhat rough and coarse texture of her loosely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
folded drapery. Dangelis was so lost in admiration
of this delicious apparition, that he hardly noticed
Lacrima’s timid farewell, as the Italian slipped away
into the garden and left them together. It was indeed
not till Gladys had descended from the little
wooden platform and coyly approached the side of his
easel, that the artist recovered himself.</p>

<p>“Upon my soul, but you look perfectly wonderful!”
he cried enthusiastically. “Quick! Let’s to business.
I want to get well started, before we have any interruption.”</p>

<p>He led her back to the platform, and made her
lean in a semi-recumbent position upon a cushioned
bench which he had prepared for the purpose. He
took a long time to satisfy himself as to her precise
pose, but at last, with a lucky flash of inspiration,
and not without assistance from Gladys herself, whose
want of æsthetic feeling was compensated for in
this case by the profoundest of all feminine instincts,
he found for her the inevitable, the supremely effective,
position. It was with a thrill of exquisite sweetness,
pervading both soul and senses, that he began
painting her. He felt as though this were one of the
few flawless and unalloyed moments of his life.
Everything in him and about him seemed to vibrate
and quiver in response to the breath of beauty and
youth. Penetrated by the delicate glow of a passion
which was free, at present, from the sting of sensual
craving, he felt as though all the accumulative impressions,
of a long procession of harmonious days,
were summed up and focussed in this fortunate hour.
The loveliness of the young girl, as he transferred it,
curve by curve, shadow by shadow, to his canvas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
seemed expressive of a reserved secret of enchantment,
until this moment withheld and concealed from
him. The ravishing contours of her lithe figure seemed
to open up, to his magnetized imagination, vistas
and corridors of emotion, such as he had never even
dreamed of experiencing. She was more than a
supremely lovely girl. She was the very epitome and
incarnation of all those sunward striving forces and
impulses, which, rising from the creative heart of the
universe, struggle upwards through the resisting
darkness. She was a Sun-child, a creature of air and
earth and fire, a daughter of Circe and Dionysus; and
as he drained the so frankly offered philtre of her
intoxicating beauty, and flung his whole soul’s response
to it in glowing color upon the canvas, he
felt that he would never again thus catch the fates
asleep, or thus plunge his hands into the nectar of
the supreme gods.</p>

<p>The world presented itself to him at that moment,
while he swept his brush with fierce passionate energy
across the canvas, as bathed in translucent and unclouded
ether. Everything it contained, of weakness
and decadence, of gloom and misgiving, seemed to be
transfigured, illuminated, swallowed up. He felt as
though, in thus touching the very secret of divine
joy, held in the lap of the abysmal mothers, nothing
but energy and beauty and creative force would
ever concern or occupy him again. All else,&mdash;all
scruples, all questions, all problems, all renunciations&mdash;seemed
but irrelevant and negligible vapour, compared
with this glorious and sunlit stream of life.
He worked on feverishly at his task. By degrees,
and in so incredibly a short time that Gladys herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
was astonished when he told her she could rest and
stretch herself a little, the figure of the Ariadne he
had seen in his imagination limned itself against the
expectant background. He was preparing to resume
his labour, and Gladys, after a boyish scramble into
the neighbouring conservatory, and an eager return
to the artist’s side with a handful of early strawberries,
was just re-mounting the platform, when the door
of the studio opened and Hugh Clavering entered.</p>

<p>He had been almost inclined,&mdash;in so morbid a
condition were his nerves&mdash;to knock at the door before
coming in, but a lucky after-thought had reminded
him that such an action would have been
scandalously inappropriate.</p>

<p>Assuming an air of boyish familiarity, which harmonized
better perhaps with her leather-bound ankles
than with her girlish figure, Gladys jumped down at
once from the little stage and ran gaily to welcome him.
She held out her hand, and then, raising both her arms
to her head and smoothing back her bright hair beneath
its circlet of bronze, she inquired of him, in a soft low
murmur, whether he thought she looked “nice.”</p>

<p>Clavering was struck dumb. He had all those
shivering sensations of trembling agitation which are
described with such realistic emphasis in the fragmentary
poem of Sappho. The playful girl, her fair
cheeks flushed with excitement and a treacherous
light in her blue eyes, swung herself upon the rough
oak table that stood in the middle of the room, and
sat there, smiling coyly at him, dangling her sandalled
feet. She still held in her hand the strawberries she
had picked; and as, with childish gusto, she put one
after another of these between her lips, she looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
him with an indescribable air of mischievous, challenging
defiance.</p>

<p>“So this is the pagan thing,” thought the poor
priest, “that it is my duty to initiate into the religion
of sacrifice!”</p>

<p>He could not prevent the passing through his brain
of a grotesque and fantastic vision in which he saw
himself, like a second hermit of the Thebaid, leading
this equivocal modern Thaïs to the waters of Jordan.
Certainly the association of such a mocking white-armed
darling of errant gods with the ceremony of
confirmation was an image somewhat difficult to embrace!
The impatient artist, apologizing profusely to
the embarrassed visitor, soon dragged off his model
to her couch on the platform, and it fell to the lot of
the infatuated priest to subside in paralyzed helplessness,
on a modest seat at the back of the room.
What thoughts, what wild unpermitted thoughts,
chased one another in strange procession through his
soul, as he stared at the beautiful heathen figure thus
presented to his gaze!</p>

<p>The movements of the artist, the heavy stream of
sunlight falling aslant the room, the sweet exotic
smells borne in from the window opening on the conservatory,
seemed all to float and waver about him,
as though they were things felt by a deep-sea diver
beneath a weight of humming waters. He gave himself
up completely to what that moment brought.</p>

<p>Faith, piety, sacrifice, devotion, became for him
mere words and phrases&mdash;broken, fragmentary, unmeaning&mdash;sounds
heard in the shadow-land of sleep,
vague and indistinct like the murmur of drowned
bells under a brimming tide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>It may well be believed that the langourously
reclining model was not in the least oblivious to the
effect she produced. This was, indeed, one of Gladys’
supreme moments, and she let no single drop of its
honeyed distillation pass undrained. She permitted
her heavy-lidded blue eyes, suffused with a soft
dreamy mist, to rest tenderly on her impassioned
lover; and as if in response to the desperate longing
in his look, a light-fluttering, half-wistful smile crossed
her parted lips, like a ripple upon a shadowy stream.</p>

<p>The girl’s vivid consciousness of the ecstasy of
power was indeed, in spite of her apparent lethargic
passivity, never more insanely aroused. Lurking
beneath the dreamy sweetness of the look with
which she responded to Clavering’s magnetized gaze,
were furtive depths of Circean remorselessness. Under
her gentian-blue robe her youthful breast trembled
with exultant pleasure, and she felt as though, with
every delicious breath she drew, she were drinking to
the dregs the very wine of the immortals.</p>

<p>“I must give Mr. Clavering some strawberries!” she
suddenly cried, jumping to her feet, and breaking
both the emotional and the æsthetic spell as if they
were gossamer-threads. “He looks bored and tired.”</p>

<p>In vain the disconcerted artist uttered an imploring
groan of dismay, as thus, at the critical moment, his
model betrayed him. In vain the bewildered priest
professed his complete innocence of any wish for
strawberries.</p>

<p>The wayward girl clambered once more through
the conservatory window, at the risk of spoiling
her Olympian attire, and returning with a handful
of fruit, tripped coquettishly up to both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
them in turn and insisted on their dividing the
spoil.</p>

<p>Had either of the two men been in a mood for
classical reminiscences, the famous image of Circe
feeding her transformed lovers might have been irresistibly
evoked. They were all three thus occupied,&mdash;the
girl in the highest spirits, and both men feeling
a little sulky and embarrassed, when, to the general
consternation, the door began slowly to open, and
a withered female figure, clad in a ragged shawl and
a still more dilapidated skirt made its entry into the
room.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Witch-Bessie!” cried Gladys, involuntarily
clutching at Clavering’s arm. “Wicked old
thing! She gave me quite a start. Well, Bessie,
what do you want here? Don’t you know the way
to the back door? You mustn’t come round to the
front like this. What do you want?”</p>

<p>Each of the model’s companions made a characteristic
movement. Dangelis began feeling in his
pocket for some suitable coin, and Clavering raised
his hand with an half-reproachful, half-conciliatory,
and altogether pastoral gesture, as if at the same
time threatening and welcoming a lost sheep of his
flock.</p>

<p>But Witch-Bessie had only eyes for Gladys. She
stared in petrified amazement at the gentian-blue
robe and the boyish sandals.</p>

<p>“Send her away!” whispered the girl to Mr.
Clavering. “Tell her to go to the back door. They’ll
give her food and things there.”</p>

<p>The cadaverous stare of the old woman relaxed
at last. Fixing her colourless eyes on the two men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and pointing at Gladys with her skinny hand, she
cried, in a shrill, querulous voice, that rang unpleasantly
through the studio, “What be she then, touzled
up in like of this? What be she then, with her
Jezebel face and her shameless looks? Round to
back door, is it, ’ee ’d have me sent? I do know
who you be, well enough, Master Clavering, and I
do guess this gentleman be him as they say does
bide here; but what be she, tricketed up in them outlandish
clothes, like a Gypoo from Roger-town
Fair? Be she Miss Gladys Romer, or baint she?”</p>

<p>“Come, Bessie,” said Clavering in propitiatory
tone. “Do as the young lady says and go round to
the back. I’ll go with you if you like. I expect
they’ll have plenty of scraps for you in that big
kitchen.”</p>

<p>He laid his hand on the old woman’s shoulder and
tried to usher her out. But she turned on him
angrily. “Scraps!” she cried. “Scraps thee own self!
What does the like of a pair of gentlemen such as
ye be, flitter-mousing and flandering round, with a
hussy like she?”</p>

<p>She turned furiously upon Gladys, waving aside
with a snort of contempt the silver coin which
Dangelis, with a vague notion that “typical English
beggars” should be cajoled with gifts, sought to press
into her hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p>“’Twas to speak a bit of my mind to ’ee, not to
beg at your blarsted back door that I did come this
fine morning! Us that do travel by night and by
day hears precious strange things sometimes. What
for, my fine lady, did ye go and swear to policeman
Frank, down in Nevilton, that ’twas I took your God-darned
pigeons? Your dad may be a swinking magistrate,
what can send poor folks to gaol for snaring
rabbities, or putting a partridge in the pot to make
the cabbage tasty, but what right does that give a
hussy like thee to send policeman Frank swearing
he’ll lock up old Bessie? It don’t suit wi’ I, this
kind of flummery; so I do tell ’ee plain and straight.
It don’t suit wi’ I!”</p>

<p>“Come, clear out of this, my good woman!” cried
the indignant clergyman, seizing the trembling old
creature by the arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t hurt her! Don’t hurt her!” exclaimed
Gladys. “She’ll put the evil eye on me. She did
it to Nance Purvis and she’s been mad ever since.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” whimpered the old woman, struggling
feebly as Clavering pulled her towards the door.</p>

<p>“It’s your own dad and Nance’s dad with their
ugly ways what have driven that poor lass moon-crazy.
Mark Purvis do whip her with withy sticks&mdash;all
the country knows it. Darn ’ee, for a black devil’s
spawn, and no blessed minister, pulling and harrying
an old woman!”</p>

<p>This last ejaculation was addressed to the furious
Mr. Clavering, who was now thrusting her by bodily
force through the open door. With one final effort
Witch-Bessie broke loose from him and turned on
the threshold. “Ye <em>shall</em> have the evil eye, since
ye’ve called for it,” she shrieked, making a wild
gesture in the air, in the direction of the shrinking
Ariadne. “And what if I let these two gentlemen
know with whom it was ye were out walking the other
night? I did see ’ee, and I do know what I did see!
I’m a pigeon-stealer am I, ye flaunting flandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Gypoo? Let me tell these dear gentlemen how as&mdash;” Her
voice died suddenly away in an incoherent
splutter, as the vicar of Nevilton, with his hand
upon her mouth, swung her out of the door.</p>

<p>Gladys sank down upon a chair pale and trembling.</p>

<p>As soon, however, as the old woman’s departure
seemed final, she began to recover her equanimity.
She gave vent to a rather forced and uneasy laugh.
“Silly old thing!” she exclaimed. “This comes of
mother’s getting rid of the dogs. She never used to
come here when we had the dogs. They scented her
out in a minute. I wish we had them now to let loose
at her! They’d make her skip.”</p>

<p>“I do hope, my dear child,” said Dangelis
anxiously, “that she has not really frightened you?
What a terrible old creature! I’ve always longed to
see a typical English witch, but bless my heart if I
want to see another!”</p>

<p>“She’s gone now,” announced Mr. Clavering, returning
hot and breathless. “I saw her half-way down
the drive. She’ll be out of sight directly. I expect
you don’t want to see any more of her, else, if you
come out here a step or two, you can see her slinking
away.”</p>

<p>Gladys thanked him warmly for his energetic defence
of her, but denied having the least wish to
witness her enemy’s retreat.</p>

<p>“It must be getting near lunch time,” she said.
“If you don’t mind waiting a moment, I’ll change
my dress.” And she tripped off behind the screens.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">AUBER LAKE</span></h2>

<p>The presence of Ralph Dangelis in Nevilton
House had altered, in more than one respect,
the relations between Gladys and her cousin.</p>

<p>The girls saw much less of each other, and Lacrima
was left comparatively at liberty to follow her own
devices.</p>

<p>On several occasions, however, when they were all
three together, it chanced that the American had
made himself extremely agreeable to the younger
girl, even going so far as to take her part, quite energetically,
in certain lively discussions. These occasions
were not forgotten by Gladys, and she hated
the Italian with a hatred more deep-rooted than
ever.</p>

<p>As soon as her first interest in the American’s
society began to pall a little, she cast about in her
mind for some further way of causing discomfort and
agitation to the object of her hatred.</p>

<p>Only those who have taken the trouble to watch
carefully what might be called the “magnetic antagonism,”
between feminine animals condemned to live
in close relations with one another, will understand the
full intensity of what this young person felt. It was
not necessarily a sign of any abnormal morbidity in
our fair-haired friend.</p>

<p>For a man in whom one is interested, even though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
such interest be mild and casual, to show a definite
tendency to take sides against one, on behalf of one’s
friend, is a sufficient justification,&mdash;at least so nature
seems to indicate&mdash;for the awakening in one’s heart
of an intense desire for revenge. Such desire is often
aroused in the most well-constituted temperaments
among us, and in this case it might be said that the
sound physical nerves of the daughter of the Romers
craved the satisfaction of such an impulse with the
same stolid persistence as her flesh and blood craved
for air and sun. But how to achieve it? What new
and elaborate humiliation to devise for this irritating
partner of her days?</p>

<p>The bathing episode was beginning to lose its
piquancy. Custom, with its kindly obliviousness, had
already considerably modified Lacrima’s fears, and
there had ceased to be for Gladys any further pleasure
in displaying her aquarian agility before a companion
so occupied with the beauty of lawn and
garden at that magical hour.</p>

<p>Fate, however, partial, as it often is, to such
patient tenacity of emotion, let fall at last, at her
very feet, the opportunity she craved.</p>

<p>She had just begun to experience that miserable
sensation, so sickeningly oppressive to a happy disposition,
of hating where she could not hurt, when,
one evening, news was brought to the house by
Mark Purvis the game-keeper that a wandering flock
of wild-geese had taken up its temporary abode amid
the reeds of Auber Lake. Mr. Romer himself
soon brought confirmation of this fact.</p>

<p>The birds appeared to leave the place during the
day and fly far westward, possibly as far as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
marshes of Sedgemoor, but they always returned at
night-fall to this new tarrying ground.</p>

<p>The very evening of this exciting discovery, Gladys’
active mind formulated a thrilling and absorbing
project, which she positively trembled with longing
to communicate to Lacrima. She found the long
dinner that night, and the subsequent chatter with
Dangelis on the terrace, almost too tedious to be
endured; and it was at an unusually early hour
that she surprised her cousin by joining her in her
room.</p>

<p>The Pariah was seated at her mirror, wearily reducing
to order her entangled curls, when Gladys
entered. She looked very fragile in her white bodice
and the little uplifted arms, that the mirror reflected,
showed unnaturally long and thin. When one hates
a person with the sort of massive hatred such as,
at that time, beat sullenly under Gladys’ rounded
bosom, every little physical characteristic in the object
of our emotion is an added incentive to our revengeful
purpose.</p>

<p>This Saturnian planetary law is unfortunately not
confined to antipathies between persons of the same
sex. Sometimes the most unhappy results have been
known to spring from the manner in which one or
another, even of two lovers, has lifted chin or head,
or moved characteristically across a room.</p>

<p>Thus it were almost impossible to exaggerate
the loathing with which this high-spirited girl contemplated
the pale oval face and slender swaying
arms of her friend, as full of her new project she
flung herself into her favourite arm chair and met
Lacrima’s frightened eyes in the gilded Georgian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
mirror. She began her attack with elaborate feline
obliquity.</p>

<p>“They say Mark Purvis’ crazy daughter has been
giving trouble again. He was up this morning, talking
to father about it.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you send her away?” said the Italian,
without turning round.</p>

<p>“Send her away? She has to do all the house-work
down there! Mark has no one else, you know, and
the poor man does not want the expense of hiring
a woman.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it rather a lonely place for a child like that?”</p>

<p>“Lonely? I should think it is lonely! But what
would you have? Somebody must keep that cottage
clean; and it’s just as well a wretched mad girl, of
no use to anyone, should do it, as that a sound person
should lose her wits in such a god-forsaken spot!”</p>

<p>“What does she do at&mdash;at these times? Is she
violent?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she gets out in the night and roams about the
woods. She was once found up to her knees in the
water. No, she isn’t exactly violent. But she is a
great nuisance.”</p>

<p>“It must be terrible for her father!”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;in a way it does bother him. But he is
not the man to stand much nonsense.”</p>

<p>“I hope he is kind to her.”</p>

<p>Gladys laughed. “What a soft-hearted darling
you are! I expect he finds sometimes that you
can’t manage mad people, any more than you can
manage children, without using the stick. But I
fancy, on the whole, he doesn’t treat her badly. He’s
a fairly good-natured man.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pariah sighed. “I think Mr. Romer ought to
send her away at once to some kind of home, and
pay someone to take her place.”</p>

<p>“I daresay you do! If you had your way, father
wouldn’t have a penny left in the bank.”</p>

<p>The Pariah rose from her seat, crossed over to the
window, and looked out into the sultry night. What
a world this was! All the gentle and troubled
beings in it seemed over-ridden by gigantic merciless
wheels!</p>

<p>A little awed, in spite of herself, by the solemnity
of her companion, Gladys sought to bring her back
out of this translunar mood by capricious playfulness.
She stretched herself out at full length in her low chair,
and calling the girl to her side, began caressing her,
pulling her down at last upon her lap.</p>

<p>“Guess what has happened!” she murmured
softly, as the quick beating of the Pariah’s heart
communicated itself to her, and made her own still
harder.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know it’s something I shan’t like, something
that I shall dread!” cried the younger girl, making
a feeble effort to escape.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you what it is?” Gladys went on,
easily overcoming this slight movement. “You know,
don’t you, that there’s a flock of wild-geese settled on
the island in the middle of Auber Lake? Well! I
have got a lovely plan. I’ve never yet seen those
birds, because they don’t come back till the evening.
What you and I are going to do, darling, is to slip
away out of the house, next time Mr. Dangelis goes
to see that friend of yours, and make straight to
Auber Lake! I’ve never been into those woods by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
night, and it’ll be extraordinarily thrilling to see
what Auber Lake looks like with the moon gleaming
on it. And then we may be able to make the wild-geese
rise, by throwing sticks or something, into the
water. Oh, it’ll be simply lovely! Don’t you think
so, darling? Aren’t you quite thrilled by the idea?”</p>

<p>The Pariah liberated herself by a sudden effort
and stood erect on the floor.</p>

<p>“I think you are the wickedest girl that God ever
made!” she said solemnly. And then, as the full
implication of the proposed adventure grew upon her,
she clasped her hands convulsively. “You cannot
mean it!” she cried. “You cannot mean it! You
are teasing me, Gladys. You are only saying it to
tease me.”</p>

<p>“Why, you’re not such a coward as all that!”
her cousin replied. “Think what it must be for
Nance Purvis, who always lives down there! I
shouldn’t like to be more cowardly than a poor crazy
labouring girl. We really <em>ought</em> to visit the place,
once in a way, to see if these stories are true about
her escaping out of the house. One can never tell
from what Mark says. He may have been drinking
and imagining it all.”</p>

<p>Lacrima turned away and began rapidly undressing.
Without a word she arranged the books on her table,
moving about like a person in a trance, and without
a word she slipped into bed and turned her face to
the wall.</p>

<p>Gladys smiled, stretched herself luxuriously, and continued
speaking.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>
<p>“Auber Lake by moonlight would well be worth
a night walk. You know it’s supposed to be the
most romantic spot in Somersetshire? They say it’s
incredibly old. Some people think it was used in
prehistoric times by the druids as a place of worship.
The villagers never dare to go near it after dark.
They say that very curious noises are heard there.
But of course that may only be the mad&mdash;”</p>

<p>She was not allowed to go on. The silent figure
in the bed suddenly sat straight up, with wide-staring
eyes fixed upon her, and said slowly and solemnly,
“If I come with you to this place, will you faithfully
promise me that your father will send that girl into
a home?”</p>

<p>Gladys was so surprised by this unexpected utterance
that she made an inarticulate gasping noise in
her throat.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, mesmerized by the Pariah’s
fixed glance. “Yes&mdash;most certainly. If you come
with me to see those wild-geese, I’ll make any
promise you like about that girl!”</p>

<p>Lacrima continued for a moment fixing her with wide-dilated
pupils.</p>

<p>Then, with a shiver that passed from head to foot,
she slowly sank back on her pillows and closed her
eyes.</p>

<p>Gladys rose a little uneasily from her chair. “But
of course,” she said, “you understand she may not
<em>want</em> to go away. She is quite crazy, you know. And
she may prefer wandering about freely among dark
woods to being locked up in a nice white-washed
asylum, under the care of fat motherly nurses!”</p>

<p>With this parting shot she went off into her own
room feeling in a curious vague manner that somehow
or another the edge of her delectation had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
taken off. In this unexpected resolution of the
Italian, the Mythology of Sacrifice had suddenly
struck a staggering blow at the Mythology of Power.
Like the point of a bright silver sword, this unforseen
vein of heroism in the Pariah cleared the sultry air
of that hot night with a magical freshness and
coolness. A planetary onlooker might have been
conscious at that moment of strange spiritual vibrations
passing to and fro over the sleeping roofs of
Nevilton. But perhaps such a one would also have
been conscious of the abysmal indifference to either
stream of opposing influence, of the high, cold galaxy
of the Milky Way, stretched contemptuously above
them all!</p>

<p>All we are able to be certain of is, that as the fair-haired
daughter of the house prepared for bed she
muttered sullenly to herself. “I’ll make her go anyway.
It will be lovely to feel her shiver, when we
pass under those thick laurels! That mad girl won’t
leave the place, unless they drag her by force.”</p>

<p>Left alone, Lacrima remained, for nearly two hours,
motionless and with closed eyes. She was not asleep,
however. Strange and desperate thoughts pursued
one another through her brain. She wondered if she,
too, like the girl of Auber Lake, were destined to
find relief from this merciless world in the unhinging
of her reason. She reverted again and again in her
mind to her cousin’s final malicious suggestion.
That would be indeed, she thought, a bitter example
of life’s irony, if after going through all this to save
the poor wretch, such sacrifice only meant worse
misery for her. But no! God could not be as unkind
as that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>She stretched out her arm for a book with which
to still the troublesome palpitation of her heart.</p>

<p>The book she seized by chance turned out to be
Andersen’s Fairy Stories, and she read herself to
sleep with the tale of the little princess who wove
coats of nettles for her enchanted brothers, and all
night long she dreamed of mad unhappy girls struggling
amid entwining branches, of bottomless lakes full
of terrible drowned faces, and of flocks of wild-geese
that were all of them kings’ sons!</p>

<p>The Saturday following this eventful colloquy between
the cousins was a day of concentrated gloom.
There was thunder in the vicinity and, although no
rain had actually fallen in Nevilton, there was a
brooding presence of it in the heavy atmosphere.</p>

<p>The night seemed to descend that evening more
quickly than usual. By eight o’clock a strange
unnatural twilight spread itself over the landscape.
The trees in the park submitted forlornly to a burden
of sultry indistinction and seemed, in their pregnant
stillness, to be trying in vain to make mysterious
signals to one another.</p>

<p>Dinner in the gracious Elizabethan dining-room
was an oppressive and discomfortable meal to all
concerned. Mrs. Romer was full of tremors and
apprehensions over the idea of a possible thunder-storm.</p>

<p>The quarry-owner was silent and preoccupied, his
mind reviewing all the complicated issues of a new
financial scheme. Dangelis kept looking at his
watch. He had promised to be at Dead Man’s Lane
by nine o’clock, and the meal seemed to drag itself
out longer than he had anticipated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a little apprehensive, too, as to what
reception he would receive when he did arrive at
Mr. Quincunx’s threshold.</p>

<p>Their last encounter had been so extremely controversial,
that he feared lest the sensitive recluse
might be harbouring one of his obstinate psychic
reactions at his expense.</p>

<p>He was very unwilling to risk the loss of Mr.
Quincunx’s society. There was no one in Nevilton
to whom he could discourse quite as freely and
philosophically as he could to the conscripted office-clerk,
and his American interest in a “representative
type” found inexhaustible satisfaction in listening to
the cynical murmurings of this eccentric being.</p>

<p>Lacrima was calm and self-contained, but she ate
hardly anything; and the hand with which she
raised her glass to her lips trembled in spite of all
her efforts.</p>

<p>Gladys herself was exuberant with suppressed
excitement. Every now and then she glanced furtively
at the window, and at other times, when there
was no reason for such an outburst, she gave vent to
a low feline laugh. She was of the type of animal that
the approach of thunder, and the presence of electricity
in the air, fills with magnetic nervous exaltation.</p>

<p>The meal was over at last, and the various persons
of the group hastened to separate, each of them
weighed upon, as if by an atmospheric hand, with
the burden of their own purposes and apprehensions.</p>

<p>The two girls retired to their rooms. Mrs. Romer
retreated to her favourite corner in the entrance hall,
and then, uneasy even here, took refuge in the assuaging
society of her friend the housekeeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Romer himself marched away gloomily to his
study; and Dangelis, snatching up his coat and hat,
made off across the south garden.</p>

<p>It did not take the American long to reach the
low hedge which separated Mr. Quincunx’s garden
from the lane. The recluse was awaiting him, and
joined him at once at the gate, giving him no invitation
to enter, and taking for granted that their conversation
was to be a pedestrian one.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx experienced a curious reluctance to
allow any of his friends to cross his threshold. The
only one completely privileged in this matter was
young Luke Andersen, whose gay urbanity was so
insidious that it would have overcome the resistance
of a Trappist monk.</p>

<p>“Well, where are you proposing to take me tonight?”
enquired Dangelis, when they had advanced
in silence some distance up the hill.</p>

<p>“To a place that will interest you, if your damned
artistic tastes haven’t quite spoiled your pleasure in
little things!”</p>

<p>“Not to the Seven Ashes again?” protested the
American. “I know this lane leads up there.”</p>

<p>“You wait a little. We shall turn off presently,”
muttered his companion. “The truth is I am taking
you on a sort of scouting expedition tonight.”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;if you must know, you shall know! I saw
Miss Traffio yesterday and she asked me to keep an
eye on Auber Lake tonight.”</p>

<p>“What? That place they were talking of? Where
the wild-geese are?”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx nodded. “It may, for all I know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
be a wild-goose chase. But I find your friend Gladys
is up to her little tricks again&mdash;frightening people
and upsetting their minds. And I promised Lacrima
that you and I would stroll round that way&mdash;just
to see that the girls don’t come to any harm. Only
we mustn’t let them know we’re there. Lacrima
would never forgive me if Gladys saw us.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that those two children are
going to wander about these confounded damp woods
of yours alone?” cried the American.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Dangelis, please understand this
quite clearly. If you ever say a word to your
precious Miss Gladys about this little scouting expedition,
that’s an end of our talks, forever and a day!”</p>

<p>The citizen of Ohio bowed with a mock heroic
gesture, removing his hat as he did so.</p>

<p>“I submit to your conditions, Don Quixote. I am
entirely at your service. Is it the idea that we
should track our friends on hands and knees? I am
quite ready even for that, but I know what these
woods of yours are like.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx vouchsafed no reply to this ill-timed
jocosity. He was anxiously surveying the tall
hedge upon their right hand. “Here’s the way,” he
suddenly exclaimed. “Here’s the path. We can hit
a short-cut here that brings us straight through
Camel’s Cover, up to Wild Pine. Then we can slip
down into Badger’s Bottom and so into the Auber
Woods.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>
<p>“But I thought the Auber Woods were much
nearer than that. You told me the other day that
you could get into the heart of them, in a quarter
of an hour from your own garden!”</p>

<p>“And so I can, my friend,” replied Mr. Quincunx,
scrambling up the bank into the field, and turning
to offer his hand to his companion. “But it happens
that this is the way those girls are coming. At any
rate that is what she said. They were going to avoid
my lane but they were going to enter the woods
from the Seven Ashes side, just because it is so
much nearer.”</p>

<p>“I submit, I submit,” muttered the artist blandly.
“I only hope this scouting business needn’t commence
till we have got well through Camel’s Cover and
Badger’s Bottom! I must confess I am not altogether
in love with the sound of those places, though
no doubt they are harmless enough. But you people
do certainly select the most extraordinary names for
your localities. Our own little lapses in these things
are classical compared with your Badgers and Camels
and Ashes and Dead Men!”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx did not condescend to reply to this.
He continued to plough his way across the field,
every now and then glancing nervously at the sky,
which grew more and more threatening. Walking
behind him and a little on one side, the American
was singularly impressed by the appearance he
presented, especially when the faint light of the
pallid and cloud-flecked moon fell on his uplifted
profile. With his corrugated brow and his pointed
beard, Mr. Quincunx was a noticeable figure at any
time, but under the present atmospheric conditions
his lean form and striking head made a picture of
forlorn desolation worthy of the sombre genius of a
Bewick.</p>

<p>Dangelis conceived the idea of a picture, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
he himself might be capable of evoking, with this
melancholy, solitary figure as its protagonist.</p>

<p>He wondered vaguely what background he would
select as worthy of the resolute hopelessness in Mr.
Quincunx’s forlorn mien.</p>

<p>It was only after they had traversed the sloping
recesses of Camel’s Cover, and had arrived at the
crest of the Wild Pine ridge, that he was able to
answer this question. Then he knew at once. The
true pictorial background for his eccentric companion
could be nothing less than that line of wind-shaken,
rain-washed Scotch firs, which, visible from all portions
of Nevilton, had gathered to themselves the
very essence of its historic tragedy.</p>

<p>These trees, like Mr. Quincunx, seemed to derive
a grim satisfaction from their submission to destiny.
Like him, they submitted with a definite volition of
resolution. They took, as he took, the line of least
resistance with a sort of stark voluptuousness. They
did not simply bow to the winds and rains that oppressed
them. They positively welcomed them. And
yet all the while, just as he did, they emitted a low
melancholy murmur of protest, a murmur as completely
different from the howling eloquence of the
ashes and elms, as it was different from the low
querulous sob of the larches and elders. The rusty-red
stain, too, in the rough bark of their trunks, was also
singularly congruous with a certain reddish tinge,
which often darkened the countenance of the recluse,
especially when his fits of goblin-humour shook him
into convulsive merriment.</p>

<p>As they paused for a moment on this melancholy
ridge, looking back at the flickering lights of the village,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and down into the darkness in front of them,
the painter made a mental vow that before he left
Nevilton he would sublimate his vision of Mr. Quincunx
into a genuine masterpiece. Plunging once
more into the shadows, they followed a dark lane
which finally emerged into a wide-sloping valley. In
the depths of this was the secluded hollow, full of
long grass and tufted reeds, which was the place
known as Badger’s Bottom.</p>

<p>The entrance to Auber Wood was now at hand;
and as they reached its sinister outskirts, they both
instinctively paused to take stock of their surroundings.
The night was more sultry than ever. The
leaves and grasses swayed with an almost imperceptible
movement, as if stirred, not by the wind, but by
the actual heavy breathing of the Earth herself,
troubled and agitated in her planetary sleep.</p>

<p>Sombre banks of clouds moved intermittently over
the face of a blurred moon, and, out of the soil at
their feet, rose up damp exotic odours, giving the
whole valley the atmosphere of an enormous hot-house.</p>

<p>It was one of those hushed, steamy nights, pregnant
and listening, which the peculiar conditions of
our English climate do not often produce, and which
are for that very reason often quite startling in their
emotional appeal. The path which the two men took,
after once they had entered the wood, was one that
led them through a gloomy tunnel of gigantic, overhanging
laurel-bushes.</p>

<p>All the chief entrances to Auber Wood were
edged with these exotics. Some capricious eighteenth-century
Seldom,&mdash;perhaps the one who raised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Tower of Pleasure on the site of the resting-place of
the Holy Rood&mdash;had planted them there, and for more
than a hundred years they had grown and multiplied.</p>

<p>Auber Lake itself was the centre of a circumference
of thick jungle-like brushwood which itself was overshadowed
by high sloping hills. These hills, also
heavily wooded, formed a sort of gigantic cup or
basin, and the level expanse of undergrowth they
enclosed was itself the margin of a yet deeper concavity,
in the middle of which was the lake-bed.</p>

<p>Mingling curiously with the more indigenous trees
in this place were several unusual and alien importations.
Some of these, like the huge laurels they were
now passing under, belonged more properly to gardens
than to woods. Others were of a still stranger
and more foreign nature, and produced a very bizarre
effect where they grew, as though one had suddenly
come upon the circle of some heathen grove, in the
midst of an English forest. Auber Lake was certainly
a spot of an unusual character. Once it had
been drained, and a large monolith, of the same stone
as that produced by Leo’s Hill, had been discovered
embedded in the mud. Traces were said to have
been discerned upon this of ancient human carving,
but local antiquarianism had contradicted this
rumour. At least it may be said that nowhere else
on the Romer estate, except perhaps in Nevilton
churchyard, was the tawny-colored clay which bore
so close a symbolic, if not a geological, relation to
the famous yellow sandstone, more heavily and
malignantly clinging, in its oozy consistence.</p>

<p>Dangelis and Mr. Quincunx advanced slowly, and
in profound silence, along their overshadowed path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>An occasional wood-pigeon, disturbed in its roosting,
flapped awkwardly through the branches; and
far away, in another part of the wood, sounded at
intervals the melancholy cry of a screech-owl.</p>

<p>Great leather-winged bats flitted over their heads
with queer unearthly little cries; and every now and
then some agitated moth, from the under-bushes,
fluttered heavily across their faces. Sometimes in
the darkness their feet stumbled upon a dead
branch, but more often they slipped uneasily in
the deep ruts left in the mud by the woodmen’s
carts.</p>

<p>All the various intermittent noises they heard only
threw the palpable stillness of the place into heavier
relief.</p>

<p>The artist from the wind-swept plains of Ohio felt
as though he had never plunged so deeply into the
indrawn recesses of the earth-powers as he was doing
now. It seemed to him as though they were approaching
the guarded precincts of some dark and crouching
idol. It was as if, by some ill-omened mistake,
they had stumbled unawares upon a spot that through
interminable ages had been forbidden to human
tread.</p>

<p>And yet the place seemed to expect them, to await
them; to have in reserve for them some laboured
pregnancy of woeful significance.</p>

<p>Once more, as he walked behind Mr. Quincunx,
Dangelis was startled by the extraordinary congruity
of that forlorn figure with the occasion and the
scene. The form of the recluse seemed to exhale a
reciprocity of fearful brooding. Auber Wood seemed
aware of him, and ready to welcome him, in consentaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
sympathy. He might have been the long-expected
priest of some immemorial rites transacted
there, the priest of some old heathen worship, perhaps
the worship of generations of dead people, buried
under those damp leaves.</p>

<p>It seemed a long while to Ralph Dangelis, in spite
of the breathless quickening of his imagination, before
the laurel-tunnel thinned away, and the two men
were able to walk side by side between the trunks of
the larger trees. Here again they encountered
Scotch firs.</p>

<p>What strange dream, of what fantastic possessor
of this solitude, had shaped itself into the planting
of these moorland giants, among the native-born
oaks and beeches of this weird place?</p>

<p>The open spaces at the foot of the tree-trunks
were filled with an obscure mass of oozy stalks and
heavily drooping leaves. The obscurity of the spot
made it difficult to discern the differences between
these rank growths; but the ghostly flowers of enormous
hemlocks stood forth from among the rest.
Fungoid excrescences, of some sort or another, were
certainly prolific here. Their charnel-house odour
set Dangelis thinking of a morgue he had once
visited.</p>

<p>At last&mdash;and with quite startling suddenness&mdash;the
path they followed emerged into a wide open
expanse; and there,&mdash;under the diffused light of the
cloud-darkened moon&mdash;they saw stretched at their
feet the dim surface of Auber Lake.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx stood for a moment motionless and
silent, leaning upon his stick. Then he turned to
his companion; and the American noticed how vague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and shadowy his face looked, as if it were a face
seen through some more opaque medium than that
of air.</p>

<p>They sat down together upon a fallen log; and out
of an instinctive desire to break the tension of the
spell that lay on him Dangelis lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>He had smoked in silence for some moments,
when Mr. Quincunx, who had been listening attentively,
raised his hand. “Hark!” he said, “do you
hear anything?”</p>

<p>Across the stillness of the water came a low blood-curdling
wail. It was hardly a human sound, and
yet it was not like the voice of any bird or beast.
It seemed to unsettle the drowsy natives of the
spot; for a harsh twittering of sedge-birds answered
it, and a great water-rat splashed down into the
lake.</p>

<p>“God! they were right then,” whispered the
American. “They spoke of some mad girl living
down here, but I did not believe them. It seemed
incredible that such a thing should be allowed.
Quick, my friend!&mdash;we ought to warn those girls
at once and get them away. This is not the sort of
thing for them to hear.”</p>

<p>They both rose and listened intently, but the sound
was not repeated; only a hot gust of wind coming, as
it were, out of the lake itself, went quivering through
the reeds.</p>

<p>“I don’t imagine,” said Mr. Quincunx calmly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
“that <em>your</em> young lady will be much alarmed. I
fancy she has less fear of this kind of thing than that
water-rat we heard just now. It’ll terrify Lacrima,
though. But I understand that your charming sweetheart
gets a good deal of amusement from causing
people to feel terror!”</p>

<p>Dangelis was so accustomed to the plain-spoken
utterances of the hermit of Dead Man’s Lane that
he received this indictment of his enchantress with
complete equanimity.</p>

<p>“All the same,” he remarked, “I think we’d better
go and meet them, if you know the direction they’re
coming. It’s not a very pleasant proposition, any
way, to face escaped lunatics in a place like this.”</p>

<p>“I tell you,” muttered Mr. Quincunx crossly, “your
darling Gladys is coming here for no other reason
than to hear that girl’s cries. The more they terrify
Lacrima, the better she’ll be pleased.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about Lacrima,” answered Dangelis.
“I know that devil of a noise will scare <em>me</em> if I hear
it again.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx did not reply. With his hand on
his companion’s arm he was once more listening
intently. At the back of his mind was gradually
forming a grim remote wish that some overt act and
palpable revelation of Gladys Romer’s interesting
character might effect a change of heart in the
citizen of Ohio.</p>

<p>Such a wish had been obscurely present in his
brain ever since they started on this expedition; and
now that the situation was developing, it took a
more vivid shape.</p>

<p>“I believe,” he remarked at last, “I hear them
coming down the path. Listen! It’s on the other
side of the pond,&mdash;over there.” He pointed across
the water to the left-hand corner of the lake. It
was from the right-hand corner, where the keeper’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
cottage stood, that the poor mad girl’s voice had
proceeded.</p>

<p>“Yes; I am sure!” he whispered after a moment’s
pause. “Come! quick! get in here; then they won’t
see us even if they walk round this way.”</p>

<p>He pulled Dangelis beneath the overhanging boughs
of a large weeping willow. The droop of this tree’s
delicate foliage made, in the semi-darkness in
which they were, a complete and impenetrable
hiding-place; and yet from between the trailing
branches, when they held them apart with their
hands, they had a free and unimpeded view of the
whole surface of the lake.</p>

<p>The sound of distant voices struck clearly now upon
their ears; and a moment after, nudging his companion,
Mr. Quincunx pointed to two cloaked figures
advancing across the open space towards the water’s
edge.</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered the recluse. “They are bound
to come this way now.”</p>

<p>The two girls were, however, for the moment, apparently
occupied with another intention. The taller
of the two stopped and picked up something from
the ground, and then approaching close to the lake’s
edge raised her arm and flung it far into the water.</p>

<p>The object she threw must have been a stick or a
stone of considerable size, for the splash it produced
was startling.</p>

<p>The result was also startling. From a little island
in the middle of the lake, rose suddenly, with a tremendous
flapping, several large and broad-winged
birds. They flew in heavy circles, at first, over the
island; and then, descending to the water’s level,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
went splashing and flapping across its surface, uttering
strange cries.</p>

<p>The noise made by these birds had hardly subsided,
as they settled down in a thick bed of reeds, when,
once more, that terrible inhuman wail rang out upon
the night. Both men peered forth anxiously from
their hiding-place, to see the effect of this sound upon
their two friends.</p>

<p>They could see that they both stood stone-still
for a moment as if petrified by terror.</p>

<p>Then they noticed that the taller of the two drew
her companion still nearer to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>“If that yell begins again,” whispered the American,
“I shall go out and speak to them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx made no answer. He prayed in his
heart that something would occur to initiate this
innocent Westerner a little more closely into the
workings of his inamorata’s mind. It seemed indeed
quite within the bounds of possibility that the recluse
might be gratified in this wish, for the girls began
rapidly advancing towards them, skirting the edge of
the lake.</p>

<p>The two men watched their approach in silence,
the artist savouring with a deep imaginative excitement
the mystical glamour of the scene.</p>

<p>He felt it would be indelibly and forever imprinted
on his mind, this hot heavily scented night, this
pallid-glimmering lake, those uneasy stirrings of the
wild-geese in their obscure reed-bed, and the frightful
hush of the listening woods, as they seemed to
await a repetition of that unearthly cry.</p>

<p>The girls had actually paused at the verge of the
lake, just in front of their hiding-place; so near, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
fact, that by stretching out his arm, from behind
his willowy screen, Dangelis could have touched
Gladys on the shoulder, when the fearfully expected
voice broke forth again upon the night.</p>

<p>The men could see the visible tremor of panic-fear
quiver through Lacrima’s slight frame.</p>

<p>“Oh, let us go!&mdash;let us go!” she pleaded, pulling
with feverish fingers at her companion’s cloak.</p>

<p>But Gladys folded her arms and flung back her
head.</p>

<p>“Little coward!” she murmured in a low unshaken
voice. “I am not afraid of a mad girl’s yelling.
Look! there’s one of those birds going back to the
island!”</p>

<p>Once more the inhuman wail trembled across the
water.</p>

<p>“Gladys! Gladys dear!” cried the panic-stricken
girl, “I cannot endure it! I shall go mad myself if
we do not go! I’ll do anything you ask me! I’ll
go anywhere with you! Only&mdash;please&mdash;let us go
away now!”</p>

<p>The sound was repeated again, and this time it
proceeded from a quarter much nearer them. All
four listeners held their breath. Presently the Italian
made a terrified gesture and pointed frantically to
the right bank of the lake.</p>

<p>“I see her!” she cried, “I see her! She is coming
towards us!”</p>

<p>The frightened girl made a movement as if she
would break away from her companion and flee into
the darkness of the trees.</p>

<p>Gladys clasped her firmly in her arms.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no!” she said, “no running off! Remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
our agreement! There’s nothing really to be afraid
of. I’m not afraid.”</p>

<p>A slight quiver in her voice a little belied the calmness
of this statement. She was indeed torn at that
moment between a very natural desire to escape
herself and an insatiable craving to prolong her
companion’s agitation.</p>

<p>In her convulsive terror the Italian, unable to free
herself from the elder girl’s enfolding arms, buried
her head in the other’s cloak.</p>

<p>Thus linked, the two might have posed for a picture
of heroic sisterly solicitude, in the presence of
extreme danger.</p>

<p>Once more that ghastly cry resounded through the
silence; and several nocturnal birds, from distant portions
of the wood, replied to it with their melancholy
hootings.</p>

<p>The white-garbed figure of the mad girl, her arms
tossed tragically above her head, came swaying
towards them. She moved unevenly, and staggered
in her advance, as if her volition had not complete
power over her movements. Gladys was evidently
considerably alarmed herself now. She clutched at
a chance of combining escape with triumph.</p>

<p>“Say you let me off that promise!” she whispered
hoarsely, “and we’ll run together! We’re quite
close to the way out.”</p>

<p>Who can read the obscure recesses of the human
mind, or gauge the supernatural strength that lurks
amid the frailest nerves?</p>

<p>This reference to her sublime contract was the one
thing needed to rouse the abandoned soul of the
Pariah. For one brief second more the powers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
darkness struggled over her bowed head with the
powers of light.</p>

<p>Then with a desperate movement the Italian rose
erect, flung aside her cousin’s arms, turned boldly
towards the approaching maniac, and ran straight to
meet her. Her unexpected appearance produced
an immediate effect upon the unhappy girl. Her
wildly-tossing arms fell to her side. Her wailing
died away in pathetic sobs, and these also quickly
ceased.</p>

<p>Lacrima seemed to act like one possessed of some
invincible magic. One might have dreamed that now
for the first time for uncounted ages this unholy
shrine of heathen tradition was invaded by an emissary
of the true Faith.</p>

<p>Gladys, who had reeled bewildered against the wood-work
of an ancient weir, that formed the outlet to
the lake, leaned in complete prostration of astonishment
upon this support, and gazed helplessly and
dumbly at the two figures. She was too petrified
with amazement to notice the appearance of Ralph
and Maurice, who, also absorbed in watching this
strange encounter, had half-emerged from their
concealment.</p>

<p>The three onlookers saw the Italian lay her hands
upon the girl’s forehead, smooth back her hair, kiss
her gently on the brow, and fling her own cloak over
her bare shoulders. They heard her murmuring
again and again some soft repetition of soothing
words. Dangelis caught the liquid syllables of the
Tuscan tongue. Evidently in her excitement the
child of Genoa the Superb had reverted to the language
of her fathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The next thing they saw was the slow retreat of the
two together, towards the keeper’s cottage; the arm
of the Italian clinging tenderly round the maniac’s
waist.</p>

<p>At this point Dangelis stepped forward and made
himself known to Gladys.</p>

<p>The expression on the face of Mr. Romer’s
daughter, when she recognized the American, was a
palimpsest of conflicting emotions. Her surprise was
still more intense when Mr. Quincunx stepped out
from the shadow of the drooping tree and raised his
hat to her. Her eyes for the moment looked positively
scared; and her mouth opened, like the mouth
of a bewildered infant. The tone with which the
citizen of Ohio addressed the confused young lady
made the heart of Mr. Quincunx leap for joy.</p>

<p>“I am astonished at you,” he said. “I should not
have believed such a thing possible! Your only excuse
is that this infernal jest of yours has turned out so
well for the people concerned, and so shamefully for
yourself. How could you treat that brave foreign
child so brutally? Why&mdash;I saw her trembling and
trembling, and trying to get away; and you were
holding&mdash;actually holding her&mdash;while that poor
mad thing came nearer! It’s a good thing for you
that the Catholic spirit in her burst out at last. Do
you know what spell she used to bring that girl to
her senses? A spell that you will never understand,
my friend, for all this baptism and confirmation
business! Why&mdash;she quoted passages out of the
Litany of Our Lady! I heard her clearly, and I recognized
the words. I am a damned atheist myself,
but if ever I felt religion to be justified it was when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
your cousin stopped that girl’s crying. It was like
real magic. You ought to be thoroughly proud of
her! I shall tell her when I see her what I feel about
her.”</p>

<p>Gladys rose from her seat on the weir and faced
them haughtily. Her surprise once over, and the
rebuke having fallen, she became mistress of herself
again.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” she said, completely ignoring Mr. Quincunx,
“we’d better follow those two, and see if Lacrima
gets her safely into the house. I fancy she’ll
have no difficulty about it. Of course if she had not
done this I should have had to do it myself. But
not knowing Italian”&mdash;she added this with a sneer&mdash;“I
am not so suitable a mad-house nurse.”</p>

<p>“It was her good heart, Gladys,” responded the
American; “not her Italian, nor her Litany, that
soothed that girl’s mind. I wish your heart, my
friend, were half as good.”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned the fair girl quite cheerfully,
“we’ll leave my heart for the present, and see how
Lacrima has got on.”</p>

<p>She took the arm which Dangelis had not offered,
but which his chivalry forbade him to refuse, and
together they proceeded to follow the heroic Genoese.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx shuffled unregarded behind them.</p>

<p>They had hardly reached the keeper’s cottage, a
desolate and ancient erection, of the usual stone
material, darkened with damp and overshadowed by
a moss-grown oak, when Lacrima herself came towards
them.</p>

<p>She started with surprise at seeing, in the shadowy
obscurity, the figures of the two men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Her surprise changed to pleasure when she recognized
their identity.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she said. “You come too late. Gladys
and I have had quite an adventure, haven’t we,
cousin?”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx glanced at the American to see if he
embraced the full generosity of the turn she gave to
the situation.</p>

<p>Gladys took advantage of it in a moment. “You
see I was right after all,” she remarked. “I knew
you would lose your alarm directly you saw that
girl! When it came to the point you were braver
than I. You dear thing!” She kissed the Italian
ostentatiously, and then retook possession of her
admirer’s arm.</p>

<p>“I got her up to her room without waking her
father,” said Lacrima. “She had left the door wide
open. Gladys is going to ask Mr. Romer to have her
sent away to some sort of home. I believe they’ll
be able to cure her. She talked quite sensibly to
me. I am sure she only wants to be treated gently.
I’m afraid her father’s unkind to her. You are going
to arrange for her being sent away, aren’t you,
Gladys?”</p>

<p>The elder girl turned. “Of course, my dear, of
course. I don’t go back on my word.”</p>

<p>The four friends proceeded to take the nearest
path through the wood. One by one the frightened
wild-geese returned to their roosting-place on the
island. The water-rats resumed uninterrupted their
night-prowls along the reedy edge of the lake, and
the wood-pigeons settled down in peace upon their
high branches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Long before Dead Man’s Lane was reached the
two couples had drifted conveniently apart in their
lingering return.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx had seldom been more tender
towards his little friend than he was that night; and
Lacrima, still strangely happy in the after-ebb of her
supernatural exultation, nestled closely to his side as
they drifted leisurely across the fields.</p>

<p>In what precise manner the deeply-betrayed Gladys
regained the confidence of her lover need not be
related. The artist from Ohio would have been adamantine
indeed, could he have resisted the appeal
which the amorous telepathy of this magnetic young
person gave her the power of expressing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in her low-pitched room, with the
shadow of the oak-tree coming and going across her
face, as the moonlight shone out or faded, Nance
Purvis lay placidly asleep, dreaming no more of
strange phantoms or of stinging whips, but of gentle
spirits from some translunar region, who caressed her
forehead with hands softer than moth’s wings and
spoke to her in a tongue that was like the moonlight
itself made audible.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">LACRIMA</span></h2>

<p>Mr. John Goring was feeding his rabbits.
In the gross texture of his clayish nature
there were one or two curious layers of a
pleasanter material. One of these, for instance, was
now shown in the friendly equanimity with which he
permitted a round-headed awkward youth, more than
half idiotic, to assist him at this innocent task.</p>

<p>Between Mr. Goring and Bert Leerd there existed
one of those inexplicable friendships, which so often,
to the bewilderment of moral philosophers, bring a
twilight of humanity into the most sinister mental
caves. The farmer had saved this youth from a conspiracy
of Poor-Law officials who were on the point
of consigning him to an asylum. He had assumed
responsibility for his good-behaviour and had given
him a lodging&mdash;his parents being both dead&mdash;in the
Priory itself.</p>

<p>Not a few young servant-girls, selected by Mr.
Goring rather for their appearance than their disposition,
had been dismissed from his service, after
violent and wrathful scenes, for being caught teasing
this unfortunate; and even the cook, a female of the
most taciturn and sombre temper, was compelled to
treat him with comparative consideration. The gossips
of Nevilton swore, as one may believe, that the
farmer, in being kind to this boy, was only obeying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the mandate of nature; but no one who had ever
beheld Bert’s mother, gave the least credence to such
a story.</p>

<p>Another of Mr. Goring’s softer aspects was his
mania for tame rabbits. These he kept in commodious
and spacious hutches at the back of his house,
and every year wonderful and interesting additions
were added to their number.</p>

<p>On this particular morning both the farmer and
his idiot were absorbed and rapt in contemplation before
the gambols of two large new pets&mdash;great silky
lop-eared things&mdash;who had arrived the night before.
Mr. Goring was feeding them with fresh lettuces,
carefully handed to him by his assistant, who divested
these plants of their rough outer leaves and dried
them on the palms of his hands.</p>

<p>“The little ’un do lap ’em up fastest, master,”
remarked the boy. “I mind how those others, with
them girt ears, did love a fresh lettuce.”</p>

<p>Mr. Goring watched with mute satisfaction the
quivering nostrils and nibbling mouth of the dainty
voracious creature.</p>

<p>“Mustn’t let them have more than three at a
time, Bert,” he remarked. “But they do love them,
as you say.”</p>

<p>“What be going to call this little ’un, master?”
asked the boy.</p>

<p>Mr. Goring straightened his back and drew a deep
breath.</p>

<p>“What do you think, Bert, my boy?” he cried, in
a husky excited tone, prodding his assistant jocosely
with the handle of his riding-whip; “What do you
think? What would you call her?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! I knew she were a she, master!” chuckled
the idiot. “I knew that, afore she were out of the
packer-case! Call ’er?” and the boy leered an indescribable
leer. “By gum! I can tell ’ee that fast
enough. Call ’er Missy Lacrima, pretty little Missy
Lacrima, wot lives up at the House, and wot is going
to be missus ’ere afore long.”</p>

<p>Mr. Goring surveyed his protégé for a moment
with sublime contentment, and then humorously
flicked at his ears with his whip.</p>

<p>“Right! my imp of Satan. Right! my spawn of
Belial. That is just what I <em>was</em> thinking.”</p>

<p>“She be silky and soft to handle,” went on the
idiot, “and her, up at the House, be no contrary,
or I’m darned mistaken.”</p>

<p>Mr. Goring expressed his satisfaction at his friend’s
intelligence by giving him a push that nearly threw
him backwards.</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell you this, my boy,” he remarked confidentially,
surveying the long line of well-filled hutches,
“we’ve never yet bought such a rabbit, as this foreign
one will turn out, or you and I be damned fools.”</p>

<p>“The young lady’ll get mighty fond of these ’ere
long-ears, looks so to me,” observed the youth. “Hope
she won’t be a feeding ’em with wet cabbage, same
as maids most often do.”</p>

<p>The farmer grew even more confidential, drawing
close to his assistant and addressing him in the tone
customary with him on market-days, when feeling
the ribs of fatted cattle.</p>

<p>“That same young lady is coming up here this
morning, Bert,” he remarked significantly. “The
squire’s giving her a note to bring along.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you be going to bring matters to a head,
master,” rejoined the boy. “That’s wise and thoughtful
of ’ee, choosing time, like, and season, as the Book
says. Maids be wonderful sly when the sun’s down,
while of mornings they be meek as guinea-fowls.”</p>

<p>The appearance of the Priory servant&mdash;no very
demure figure&mdash;put a sudden stop to these touching
confidences.</p>

<p>“Miss Lacrima, with a note, in the front Parlour!”
the damsel shouted.</p>

<p>“You needn’t call so loud, girl,” grumbled the
farmer. “And how often must I tell you to say
‘Miss Traffio,’ not ‘Miss Lacrima’?”</p>

<p>The girl tossed her head and pouted her lips.</p>

<p>“A person isn’t used to waiting on foreigners,” she
muttered.</p>

<p>Mr. Goring’s only reply to this remark was to
pinch her arm unmercifully. He then pushed her
aside, and entering the kitchen, walked rapidly
through to the front of the house. The front parlour
in the Priory was nothing more or less than the old
entrance-gate of the Cistercian Monastery, preserved
through four centuries, with hardly a change.</p>

<p>The roof was high and vaulted. In the centre of
the vault a great many-petalled rose, carved in
Leonian stone, seemed to gather all the curves and
lines of the masonry together, and hold them in
religious concentration.</p>

<p>The fire-place&mdash;a thing of more recent, but still
sufficiently ancient date&mdash;displayed the delicate and
gracious fantasy of some local Jacobean artist, who
had lavished upon its ornate mouldings a more personal
feeling than one is usually aware of in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
things. In place of a fire the wide grate was, at this
moment, full of new-grown bracken fronds, evidently
recently picked, for they were still fresh and green.</p>

<p>In front of the fire-place stood Lacrima with the
letter in her hand. Had Mr. Goring been a little less
persuaded of the “meekness” of this young person,
he would have recognized something not altogether
friendly to himself and his plans in the strained white
face she raised to him and the stiff gloved hand she
extended.</p>

<p>He begged her to be seated. She waved aside the
chair he offered, and handed him the letter. He tore
this open and glanced carelessly at its contents.</p>

<p>The letter was indeed brief enough, containing
nothing but the following gnomic words: “Refusal
or no refusal,” signed with an imperial flourish.</p>

<p>He flung it down on the table, and came to business
at once.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t let that little mistake of Auber
Great Meadow mean anything, missie,” he said.
“You were too hasty with a fellow that time&mdash;too
hasty and coy-like. Those be queer maids’ tricks,
that crying and running! But, bless my heart!
I don’t bear you any grudge for it. You needn’t
think it.”</p>

<p>He advanced a step&mdash;while she retreated, very
pale and very calm, her little fingers clasped nervously
together. She managed to keep the table between
them, so that, barring a grotesque and obvious pursuit
of her, she was well out of his reach.</p>

<p>“I have a plain and simple offer to make to you,
my dear,” he continued, “and it is one that can do
you no hurt or shame. I am not one of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
waste words in courting a girl, least of all a young
lady of education like yourself. The fact is, I am
a lonely man&mdash;without wife or child&mdash;and as far
as I know no relations on earth, except brother
Mortimer. And I have a pretty tidy sum laid up in
Yeoborough Bank, and the farm is a good farm. I
do not say that the house is all that could be wished;
but ’tis a pretty house, too, and one that could stand
improvement. In plain words, dearie, what I want
you to say now is ‘yes,’ and no nonsense,&mdash;for what
I am doing,” his voice became quite husky at this
point, as if her propinquity really did cause him some
emotion, “is asking you, point-blank, and no beating
about the bush, whether you will marry me!”</p>

<p>Lacrima’s face during this long harangue would
have formed a strange picture for any old Cistercian
monk shadowing that ancient room. At first she
had kept unmoved her strained and tensely-strung
impassivity. But by degrees, as the astounding
character of the man’s communication began to dawn
upon her, her look changed into one of sheer blind
terror. When the final fatal word crossed the
farmer’s lips, she put her hand to her throat as though
to suppress an actual cry. She had never looked
for this;&mdash;not in her wildest dreams of what destiny,
in this curst place, could inflict upon her. This
surpassed the worst of possible imagination! It was
a deep below the deep. She found herself at first
completely unable to utter a word. She could only
make a vague helpless gesture with her hand as
though dumbly waving the whole world away.</p>

<p>Then at last with a terrible effort she broke the
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>“What you say is utterly&mdash;utterly impossible!
It is&mdash;it is too&mdash;”</p>

<p>She could not go on. But she had said enough to
carry, even to a brain composed of pure clay, the
conviction that the acquiescence he demanded was
not a thing to be easily won. He thought of his
brother-in-law’s enigmatic note. Possibly the owner
of Leo’s Hill had ways of persuading recalcitrant
foreign girls that were quite hidden from him. The
psychological irony of the thing lay in the fact that
in proportion as her terror increased, his desire for
her increased proportionally. Had she been willing,&mdash;had
she been even passive and indifferent,&mdash;the curious
temperament of Mr. Goring would have been
scarcely stirred. He might have gone on pursuing
her, out of spite or out of obstinacy; but the pursuit
would have been no more than an interlude, a distraction,
among his other affairs.</p>

<p>But that look of absolute terror on her face&mdash;the
look of a hunted animal under the hot breath of the
hounds&mdash;appealed to something profoundly deep in
his nature. Oddly enough&mdash;such are the eccentricities
of the human mind&mdash;the very craving to
possess her which her terror excited, was accompanied
by a rush of extraordinary pity for himself as the
object of her distaste.</p>

<p>He let her pass&mdash;making no movement to interrupt
her escape. He let her hurry out of the garden
and into the road&mdash;without a word; but as soon as
she was gone, he sat down on the wooden seat under
the front of the house and resting his head upon his
chin began blubbering like a great baby. Big salt
tears fell from his small pig’s eyes, rolled down his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
tanned cheeks, and falling upon the dust caked it
into little curious globules.</p>

<p>Two wandering ants of a yellowish species, dragging
prisoner after them one of a black kind, encountered
these minute globes of sand and sorrow, and explored
them with interrogatory feelers.</p>

<p>Mingled with this feeling of pity for himself under
the girl’s disdain was a remarkable wave of immense
tenderness and consideration for her. Short of letting
her escape him, how delicately he would cherish, how
tenderly he would pet and fondle her, how assiduously
he would care for her! The consciousness of this
emotion of soft tenderness towards the girl increased
his pity for himself under the weight of the girl’s
contempt. How ungrateful she was! And yet that
very look of terror, that stifled cry of the hunted
hare, which made him so resolved to win her, produced
in him an exquisite feeling of melting regard
for her youth, her softness, her fragility. When she
did belong to him, oh how tenderly he would treat
her! How he would humour her and give her everything
she could want!</p>

<p>The shadowy Cistercian monks would no doubt,
from their clairvoyant catholic knowledge of the
subtleties of the human soul, have quite understood
the cause of those absurd tears caking the dust under
that wooden seat. But the yellowish ants continued
to be very perplexed and confused by their presence.
Thunder-drops tasting of salt were no doubt as
strange to them as hail-stones tasting of wine would
have been to Mr. Goring. But the ants were not the
only creatures amazed at this new development in
the psychology of the man of clay. From one corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of the house peeped the servant-girl, full of tremulous
curiosity, and from another the idiot Bert shuffled
and spied, full of most anxious and perturbed concern.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the innocent cause of this little drama
was making her way with drooping head and dragging
steps down the south drive. When she reached
the house she was immediately informed by one of
the servants that Mr. Romer wished to see her in the
study.</p>

<p>She was so dazed and broken, so forlorn and indifferent,
that she made her way straight to this room
without pause or question.</p>

<p>She found Mr. Romer in a most lively and affable
mood. He made her sit down opposite him, and
handed her chocolates out of a decorative Parisian
box which lay on the table.</p>

<p>“Well, young lady,” he said, “I know, without
your telling me, that an important event has occurred!
Indeed, to confess the truth, I have, for a
long time, foreseen its occurrence. And what did you
answer to my worthy brother’s flattering proposal? It
isn’t every girl, in your peculiar position, who is as
lucky as this. Come&mdash;don’t be shy! There is no
need for shyness with me. What did you say to
him?”</p>

<p>Lacrima looked straight in front of her out of the
window. She saw the waving branches of a great
dark yew-tree and above it the white clouds. She
felt like one whose guardian-angel has deserted her,
leaving her the prey of blind elemental forces.
She thought vaguely in her mind that she would
make a desperate appeal to Vennie Seldom. Something
in Vennie gave her a consciousness of strength.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
To this strength, at the worst, she would cling for
help. She was thus in a measure fortified in advance
against any outburst in which her employer might
indulge. But Mr. Romer indulged in no outburst.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he said calmly, “that I may take for
granted that you have refused my good brother’s
offer?”</p>

<p>Lacrima nodded, without speaking.</p>

<p>“That is quite what I expected. You would not
be yourself if you had not done so. And since you
have done so it is of course quite impossible for me
to put any pressure upon you.”</p>

<p>He paused and carefully selecting the special kind
of chocolate that appealed to him put it deliberately
in his mouth.</p>

<p>Lacrima was so amazed at the mild tone he used
and at the drift of his words, that she turned full
upon him her large liquid eyes with an expression
in them of something almost like gratitude. The corners
of her mouth twitched. The reaction was too
great. She felt she could not keep back her tears.</p>

<p>Mr. Romer quietly continued.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>
<p>“In all these things, my dear young lady, the world
presents itself as a series of bargains and compromises.
My brother has made you his offer&mdash;a
flattering and suitable one. In the girlish excitement
of the first shock you have totally refused to
listen to him. But the world moves round. Such
natural moods do not last forever. They often do
not last beyond the next day! In order to help you&mdash;to
make it easier for you&mdash;to bring such a mood
to an end, I also, in my turn, have a little proposal
to make.”</p>

<p>Lacrima’s expression changed with terrible rapidity;
she stared at him panic-stricken.</p>

<p>“My proposal is this,” said Mr. Romer, quietly
handing her the box of chocolates, and smiling as she
waved it away. “As I said just now, the world is a
place of bargains and compromises. Nothing ever
occurs between human beings which is not the result
of some unuttered transaction of occult diplomacy.
Led by your instincts you reject my brother’s offer.
Led by my instincts I offer you the following persuasion
to overcome your refusal.”</p>

<p>He placed another chocolate in his mouth.</p>

<p>“I know well,” he went on, “your regard and fondness&mdash;I
might use even stronger words&mdash;for our
friend Maurice Quincunx. Now what I propose is
this. I will settle upon Maurice,&mdash;you shall see
the draft itself and my signature upon it,&mdash;an income
sufficient to enable him to live comfortably and happily,
wherever he pleases, without doing a stroke of
work, and without the least anxiety. I will arrange
it so that he cannot touch the capital of the sum
I make over to him, and has nothing to do but to
sign receipts for each quarter’s dividend, as the bank
makes them over to him.</p>

<p>“The sum I will give him will be so considerable,
that the income from it will amount to not less than
three hundred pounds a year. With this at his disposal
he will be able to live wherever he likes, either
here or elsewhere. And what is more,”&mdash;here Mr.
Romer looked intently and significantly at the trembling
girl&mdash;“what is more, he will be in a position
to <em>marry</em> whenever he may desire to do so. I believe”&mdash;he
could not refrain from a tone of sardonic irony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
as he added this&mdash;“that you have found him not
particularly well able to look after himself. I shall
sign this document, rendering your friend free from
financial anxiety for the rest of his life, on the day
when you are married to Mr. Goring.”</p>

<p>When he had finished speaking Lacrima continued
to stare at him with a wide horror-struck gaze.</p>

<p>Mechanically she noticed the peculiar way in
which his eyebrows met one another across a scar
on his forehead. This scar and the little grey bristles
that crossed it remained in her mind long afterwards,
indelibly associated with the thoughts that then
passed through her brain. Chief among these thoughts
was a deep-lurking, heart-clutching dread of her own
conscience, and a terrible shapeless fear that this subterranean
conscience might debar her from the <em>right</em>
to make her appeal to Vennie. From Mr. Romer’s persecution
she could appeal; but how could she appeal
against his benevolence to her friend, even though the
path of that benevolence lay over her own body?</p>

<p>She rose from her seat, too troubled and confused
even to hate the man who thus played the part of
an ironic Providence.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” she said, waving aside once more the
bright-coloured box of chocolates which he had the
diabolical effrontery to offer her again. “Let me go.
I want to be alone. I want to think.”</p>

<p>He opened the door for her, and she passed out.
Once out of his presence she rushed madly upstairs
to her own room, flung herself on the bed, and remained,
for what seemed to her like centuries of
horror, without movement and without tears, staring
up at the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>The luncheon bell sounded, but she did not heed
it. From the open window floated in the smell of
the white cluster-roses, scented like old wine, which
encircled the terrace pillars. Blending with this
fragrance came the interminable voice of the wood-pigeons,
and every now and then a sharp wild cry,
from the peacocks on the east lawn. Two&mdash;three
hours passed thus, and still she did not move. A
certain queer-shaped crack above the door occupied
her superficial attention, very much in the same way
as the scar on Mr. Romer’s forehead. Any very
precise formulation of her thoughts during this long
period would be difficult to state.</p>

<p>Her mind had fallen into that confused and feverish
bewilderment that comes to us in hours between
sleeping and waking. The clearest image that shaped
itself to her consciousness during these hours was the
image of herself as dead, and, by means of her death,
of Maurice Quincunx being freed from his hated
office-work, and enabled to live according to his
pleasure. She saw him walking to and fro among
rows of evening primroses&mdash;his favourite flowers&mdash;and
in place of a cabbage-leaf&mdash;so fantastic were her
dreams&mdash;she saw his heavy head ornamented with
a broad, new Panama-hat, purchased with the price
of her death.</p>

<p>Her mind gave no definite shape or form to this
image of herself dying. The thought of it followed
so naturally from the idea of a union with the
Priory-tenant, that there seemed no need to separate
the two things. To marry Mr. John Goring was just
a simple sentence of death. The only thing to make
sure of, was that before she actually died, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
precious document, liberating her friend forever,
should be signed and sealed. Oddly enough she never
for a moment doubted Mr. Romer’s intention of carrying
out his part of the contract if she carried out hers.
As he had said, the world was designed and arranged
for bargains between men and women; and if her
great bargain meant the putting of life itself into
the scale&mdash;well! she was ready.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the final issue of her feverish
self-communings was a sense of deep and indescribable
peace. It was more of a relief to her than anyone
not acquainted with the peculiar texture of a Pariah’s
mind could realize, to be spared that desperate appeal
to Vennie Seldom. In a dumb inarticulate way she
felt that, without making such an appeal, the spirit
of the Nevilton nun was supporting and strengthening
her. Did Vennie know of her dilemma, she would
be compelled to resort to some drastic step to stop
the sacrifice, just as one would be compelled to hold
out a hand of rescue to some determined suicide. But
she felt in the depths of her heart that if Vennie
were in her position she would make the same
choice.</p>

<p>The long afternoon was still only half over, when&mdash;comforted
and at peace with herself, as a devoted
patriot might be at peace, when the throw of the
dice has appointed him as his country’s liberator&mdash;she
rose from her recumbent position, and sitting on
the edge of her bed turned over the pages of her
tiny edition of St. Thomas à Kempis.</p>

<p>It had been long since she had opened this volume.
Indeed, isolated from contact with any Catholic
influence except that of the philosophical Mr. Taxater,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Lacrima had been recently drifting rather far away
from the church of her fathers. This complete upheaval
of her whole life threw her back upon her old
faith.</p>

<p>Like so many other women of suppressed romantic
emotions, when the moment came for some heroic
sacrifice for the sake of her friend, she at once threw
into the troubled waters the consecrated oil that had
anointed the half-forgotten piety of her childhood.</p>

<p>One curious and interesting psychological fact in
connection with this new trend of feeling in her, was
the fact that the actual realistic horror of being, in
a literal and material sense, at the mercy of Mr. John
Goring never presented itself to her mind at all.
Its very dreadfulness, being a thing that amounted to
sheer death, blurred and softened its tangible and
palpable image.</p>

<p>Yet it must not be supposed that she meditated
definitely upon any special line of action. She formulated
no plan of self-destruction. For some strange
reason, it was much less the bodily terror of the
idea that rose up awful and threatening before her,
than its spiritual and moral counterpart.</p>

<p>Had Lacrima been compelled, like poor Sonia in the
Russian novel, to become a harlot for the sake of
those she loved, it would have been the mental
rather than the physical outrage that would have
weighed upon her.</p>

<p>She was of that curious human type which separates
the body from the soul, in all these things.
She had always approached life rather through her
mind than through her senses, and it was in the imagination
that she found both her catastrophes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
recoveries. In this particular case, the obsessing image
of death had for the moment quite obliterated the
more purely realistic aspect of what she was contemplating.
Her feeling may perhaps be best described
by saying that whenever she imaged the farmer’s
possession of her, it was always as if what he possessed
was no more than a dead inert corpse, about
whose fate none, least of all herself, could have any
further care.</p>

<p>She had just counted the strokes of the church
clock striking four, when she heard Gladys’ steps in
the adjoining room. She hurriedly concealed the
little purple-covered volume, and lay back once more
upon her pillows. She fervently prayed in her heart
that Gladys might be ignorant of what had occurred,
but her knowledge of the relations between father and
daughter made this a very forlorn hope.</p>

<p>Such as it was, it was entirely dispelled as soon as
the fair-haired creature glided in and sat down at
the foot of her bed.</p>

<p>Gladys looked at her cousin with intent and luxurious
interest; her expression being very much what
one might suppose the countenance of a young pagan
priestess to have worn, as she gazed, dreamily and
sweetly, in a pause of the sacrificial procession, at
some doomed heifer “lowing at the skies, and all her
silken flanks with garlands dressed.”</p>

<p>“So I hear that you are going to be married,” she
began at once, speaking in a slow, liquid voice, and
toying indolently with her friend’s shoe-strings.</p>

<p>“Please&mdash;please don’t talk about it,” murmured
the Italian. “Nothing is settled yet. I would so
much rather not think of it now.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, how silly!” cried the other, with a melodious
little laugh. “Of course we must talk about it. It is
so extremely exciting! I shall be seeing uncle John
today and I must congratulate him. I am sure he
doesn’t half know how lucky he is.”</p>

<p>Lacrima jumped up from where she lay and stepping
to the window looked out over the sunlit park.</p>

<p>Gladys rose too, and standing behind her cousin,
put her arms round her waist.</p>

<p>“No, I am sure he doesn’t realize how sweet you
are,” she whispered. “You darling little thing,&mdash;you
little, shy, frightened thing&mdash;you must tell me
all about it! I’ll try not to tease you&mdash;I really
will! What a clever, naughty little girl, it has been,
peeping and glancing at a poor elderly farmer and
inflaming his simple heart! But all your friends are
rather well advanced in age, aren’t they, dear? I
expect uncle John is really no older than Mr. Quincunx
or James Andersen. What tricks do you use, darling,
to attract all these people?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what it is! It’s the way you clasp
your fingers, and keep groping with your hands in
the air in front of you, as if you were blind. I’ve
noticed that trick of yours for a long time. I expect
it attracts them awfully! I expect they all long to
take those little wrists and hold them tight! And
the drooping, dragging way you walk, too; that no
doubt they find quite enthralling. It has often irritated
<em>me</em>, but I can quite see now why you do it.
It must make them long to support you in their
strong arms! What a crafty little puss she is! And
I have sometimes taken her for no better than a
little simpleton! I see I shall not for long be the
only person allowed to kiss our charming Lacrima!
So I must make the best of my opportunities,
mustn’t I?”</p>

<p>Suiting her action to her words she turned the girl
towards her with a vigorous movement, and overcoming
her reluctance, embraced her softly, whispering,
as she kissed her averted mouth,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Uncle John won’t do this half so prettily as I do,
will he? But oh, how you must have played your
tricks upon him&mdash;cunning, cunning little thing!”</p>

<p>Lacrima had by this time reached the end of her
endurance. With a sudden flash of genuine Italian
anger she flung her cousin back, with such unexpected
violence, that the elder girl would actually have
fallen to the floor, if she had not encountered in her
collapse the arm of the wicker chair which stood
behind her.</p>

<p>She rose silent and malignant.</p>

<p>“So that’s what we gentle, wily ones do, is it,
when we lose our little tempers! All right, my
friend, all right! I shall remember.”</p>

<p>She walked haughtily to the door that divided their
rooms.</p>

<p>“The sooner I am married,” she cried, as a final
hit, “the sooner <em>you</em> will be&mdash;and I shall be married
soon&mdash;soon&mdash;soon; perhaps before this summer is
out!”</p>

<p>Lacrima stood for some moments rigid and unmoving.
Then there came over her an irresistible
longing to escape from this house, and flee far off,
anywhere, anyhow, so long as she could be alone with
her misery, alone with her tragic resolution.</p>

<p>The invasion of Gladys had made this resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
a very different thing from what it had seemed an
hour ago. But she must recover herself! She must
see things again in the clearer, larger light of sublime
sacrifice. She must purge the baseness of her cousin’s
sensual magnetism out of her brain and her heart!</p>

<p>She hurriedly fastened on her hat, took her faded
parasol, slipped the tiny St. Thomas into her dress,
and ran down the great oak staircase. She hurried
past the entrance without turning aside to greet the
impassive Mrs. Romer, seated as usual in her accustomed
place, and skirting the east lawns emerged
from the little postern-gate into the park. Crossing
a half-cut hay-field and responding gravely and gently
to the friendly greetings of the hay-makers, she
entered the Yeoborough road just below the steep
ascent, between high overshadowing hedges, of Dead
Man’s Lane.</p>

<p>Whether from her first exit from the house, she
had intended to follow this path, she could hardly
herself have told. It was the instinct of a woman at
bay, seeking out, not the strong that could help her,
but the weak that she herself could help. It was
also perhaps the true Pariah impulse, which drives
these victims of the powerful and the well-constituted,
to find rehabilitation in the society of one another.</p>

<p>As she ascended the shadowy lane with its crumbling
banks of sandy soil and its overhanging trees,
she felt once again how persistently this heavy
luxuriant landscape dragged her earthwards and
clogged the wings of her spirit. The tall grasses
growing thick by the way-side enlaced themselves
with the elder-bushes and dog-wood, which in their
turn blended indissolubly with the lower branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of the elms. The lane itself was but a deep shadowy
path dividing a flowing sea of foliage, which seemed
to pour, in a tidal wave of suffocating fertility, over
the whole valley.</p>

<p>The Italian struggled in vain against the depressing
influence of all these rank and umbrageous growths,
spreading out leafy arms to catch her and groping
towards her with moist adhesive tendrils. The lane
was full of a warm steamy vapour, like that of a
hot-house, to the heavy odour of which, every sort
of verdurous growing thing offered its contribution.</p>

<p>There was a vague smell of funguses in the air,
though none were visible; and the idea of them may
only have been due to the presence of decaying wood
or the moist drooping stalks of the dead flowers of
the earlier season. Now and again the girl caught,
wafted upon a sudden stir of wind, the indescribably
sweet scent of honey-suckle&mdash;a sweetness almost
overpowering in its penetrating voluptuous approach.
Once, high up above her head, she saw a spray of this
fragrant parasite; not golden yellow, as it is where
the sun shines full upon it, but pallid and ivory-white.
In a curious way it seemed as if this Nevilton scenery
offered her no escape from the insidious sensuality
she fled.</p>

<p>The indolent luxuriousness of Gladys seemed to
breathe from every mossy spore and to over-hang
every unclosing frond. And if Gladys was in the
leaves and grass, the remoter terror of Mr. Goring
was in the earth and clay. Between the two they
monopolized this whole corner of the planet, and
made everything between zenith and nadir their
privileged pasture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>As she drew nearer to where Mr. Quincunx lived,
her burdened mind sought relief in focussing itself
upon him. She would be sure to find him in his
garden. That she knew, because the day was Saturday.
Should she tell him what had happened to her?</p>

<p>Ah! that was indeed the crucial question! Was it
necessary that she should sacrifice herself for him
without his even knowing what she did?</p>

<p>But he would have to know, sooner or later, of
this marriage. Everyone would be talking of it. It
would be bound to come to his ears.</p>

<p>And what would he think of her if she said nothing?
What would he think of her, in any case, having
accepted such a degradation?</p>

<p>Not to tell him at all, would throw a completely
false light upon the whole transaction. It would make
her appear treacherous, fickle, worldly-minded, shameless&mdash;wickedly
false to her unwritten covenant with
himself.</p>

<p>To tell him, without giving him the true motive of
her sacrifice, would be, she felt sure, to bring down
his bitterest reproaches on her head.</p>

<p>For a passing second she felt a wave of indignation
against him surge up in her heart. This, however,
she passionately suppressed, with the instinctive desire
of a woman who is sacrificing herself to feel the
object of such sacrifice worthy of what is offered.</p>

<p>It was not long before she reached the gate of Mr.
Quincunx’s garden. Yes,&mdash;there he was&mdash;with his
wheel-barrow and his hoe&mdash;bending over his potatoes.
She opened the gate and walked quite close
up to him before he observed her. He greeted her in
his usual manner, with a smile of half-cynical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
half-affectionate welcome, and taking her by the hand
as he might have taken a child, he led her to the
one shady spot in his garden, where, under a weeping
ash, he had constructed a rough bench.</p>

<p>“I didn’t expect you,” he said, when they were
seated. “I never do expect you. People like me who
have only Saturday afternoons to enjoy themselves
in don’t expect visitors. They count the hours
which are left to them before the night comes.”</p>

<p>“But you have Sunday, my friend,” she said, laying
her hand upon his.</p>

<p>“Sunday!” Mr. Quincunx muttered. “Do you call
Sunday a day? I regard Sunday as a sort of prison-exercise,
when all the convicts go walking up and
down and showing off their best clothes. I can neither
work nor read nor think on Sunday. I have to put on
my best clothes like the rest, and stand at my gate,
staring at the weather and wondering what the
hay-crop will be. The only interesting moments I
have on Sunday are when that silly-faced Wone, or
one of the Andersens, drifts this way, and we lean
over my wall and abuse the gentry.”</p>

<p>“Poor dear!” said the girl pityingly. “I expect
the real truth is that you are so tired with your work
all the week, that you are glad enough to rest and
do nothing.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx’s nostrils dilated, and his drooping
moustache quivered. A smile of delicious and sardonic
humour wavered over the lower portion of his
face, while his grey eyes lost their sadness and
gleamed with a goblin-like merriment.</p>

<p>“I am getting quite popular at the office,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
“I have learnt the secret of it now.”</p>

<p>“And what is the secret?” asked Lacrima, suppressing
a queer little gasp in her throat.</p>

<p>“Sucking up,” Mr. Quincunx answered, his face
flickering with subterranean amusement, “sucking up
to everyone in the place, from the manager to the
office boy.”</p>

<p>Lacrima returned to him a very wan little smile.</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean ingratiating yourself,” she
said; “you English have such funny expressions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ingratiating myself, pandering to them, flattering
them, agreeing with them, anticipating their
wishes, doing their work for them, telling lies for
them, abusing God to make them laugh, introducing
them to Guy de Maupassant, and even making a
few light references, now and again, to what Shakespeare
calls ‘country-matters.’”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word you say,” protested Lacrima
in rather a quavering voice. “I believe you hate them
all and that they are all unkind to you. But I can quite
imagine you have to do more work than your own.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx’s countenance lost its merriment
instantaneously.</p>

<p>“I believe you are as annoyed as Mr. Romer,” he
said, “that I should get on in the office. But I am
past being affected by that. I know what human
nature is! We are all really pleased when other
people get on badly, and are sorry when they do
well.”</p>

<p>Lacrima felt as though the trees in the field opposite
had suddenly reversed themselves and were
waving their roots in the air.</p>

<p>She gave a little shiver and pressed her hand to
her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx continued.</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t like it when I tell you the
truth. Nobody likes to hear the truth. Human
beings lap up lies as pigs lap up milk. And women
are worst of all in that! No woman really can love
a person&mdash;not, at any rate, for long&mdash;who tells
her the truth! That is why women love clergymen,
because clergymen are brought up to lie. I saw you
laughing and amusing yourself the other evening with
Mr. Clavering&mdash;you and your friend Gladys. I
went the other way, so as not to interrupt such a
merry conversation.”</p>

<p>Lacrima turned upon him at this.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand how you can say such things
of me!” she cried. “It is too much. I won’t&mdash;I
won’t listen to it!”</p>

<p>Her over-strained nerves broke down at last, and
covering her face with her hands, she burst into a fit
of convulsive sobs.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx rose and stood gazing at her,
gloomily plucking at his beard.</p>

<p>“And such are women!” he thought to himself.
“One can never tell them the least truth but they
burst into tears.”</p>

<p>He waited thus in silence for one or two moments,
and then an expression of exquisite tenderness and
sympathy came into his face. His patient grey eyes
looked at her bowed head with the look of a sorrowful
god. Gently he sat down beside her and laid his
hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>
<p>“Lacrima&mdash;dear&mdash;I am sorry&mdash;I oughtn’t to
have said that. I didn’t mean it. On my solemn
oath I didn’t mean it! Lacrima, please don’t cry. I
can’t bear it when you cry. It was all absolute nonsense
what I said just now. It is the devil that
gets into me and makes me say those things!
Lacrima&mdash;darling Lacrima&mdash;we won’t tease one
another any more.”</p>

<p>Her sobs diminished under the obvious sincerity
of his words. She lifted up a tear-stained face and
threw her arms passionately round his neck.</p>

<p>“I’ve no one but you,” she cried, “no one, no one!”</p>

<p>For several minutes they embraced each other in
silence&mdash;the girl’s breast quivering with the after-sighs
of her emotion and their tears mingling together
and falling on Mr. Quincunx’s beard. Had Gladys
Romer beheld them at that moment she would certainly
have been strengthened in her healthy-minded
mocking contempt for sentimental “slobbering.”</p>

<p>When they had resumed a more normal mood their
conversation continued gently and quietly.</p>

<p>“Of course you are right,” said Mr. Quincunx. “I
am not really happy at the office. Who <em>could</em> be
happy in a place of that kind? But it is my life&mdash;and
one has to do what one can with one’s life! I
have to pretend to myself that they like me there, and
that I am making myself useful&mdash;otherwise I simply
could not go on. I have to pretend. That’s what
it is! It is my pet illusion, my little fairy-story. It
was that that made me get angry with you&mdash;that and
the devil. One doesn’t like to have one’s fairy-stories
broken into by the brutal truth.”</p>

<p>“Poor dear!” said Lacrima softly, stroking his
hand with a gesture of maternal tenderness.</p>

<p>“If there was any hope of this wretched business
coming to an end,” Maurice went on, “it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
different. Then I would curse all these people to
hell and have done with it. But what can I do?
I am already past middle age. I shouldn’t be able
to get anything else if I gave it up. And I don’t
want to leave Nevilton while you are here.”</p>

<p>The girl looked intently at him. Then she folded
her hands on her lap and began gravely.</p>

<p>“I have something to tell you, Maurice dear.
Something very important. What would you say if
I told you that it was in my power to set you free
from all this and make you happy and comfortable
for the rest of your life?”</p>

<p>An invisible watcher from some more clairvoyant
planet than ours would have been interested at that
moment in reading the double weakness of two poor
Pariah hearts. Lacrima, brought back from the half-insane
attitudes of her heroic resolution by the intermission
of natural human emotion, found herself on
the brink of half-hoping that her friend would completely
and indignantly refuse this shameful sacrifice.</p>

<p>“Surely,” her heart whispered, “some other path of
escape must offer itself for them both. Perhaps,
after all, Vennie Seldom might discover some way.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx, on the other hand, was most thoroughly
alarmed by her opening words. He feared
that she was going to propose some desperate scheme
by which, fleeing from Nevilton together, she was to
help him earn money enough for their mutual support.</p>

<p>“What should I say?” he answered aloud, to the
girl’s question. “It would depend upon the manner
in which you worked this wonderful miracle. But I
warn you I am not hopeful. Things might be worse.
After all I have a house to return to. I have food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
I have my books. I have you to come and pay me
visits. I have my garden. In this world, when a
person has a roof over his head, and someone to talk
to every other day, he had better remain still and
not attract the attention of the gods.”</p>

<p>Silence followed his words. Instead of speaking,
Lacrima took off her hat, and smoothed her hair
away from her forehead, keeping her eyes fixed upon
the ground. An immense temptation seized her to
let the moment pass without revealing her secret.
She could easily substitute any imaginary suggestion
in place of the terrible reality. Her friend’s morbid
nerves would help her deception. The matter would
be glossed over and be as if it had never been: be, in
fact, no more than it was, a hideous nightmare of
her own insane and diseased conscience.</p>

<p>But could the thing be so suppressed? Would it
be like Nevilton to let even the possible image of
such a drama pass unsnatched at by voluble tongues,
unenlarged upon by malicious gossip?</p>

<p>He would be bound to hear of Mr. Goring’s offer.
That, at least, could not be concealed. And what
assurance had she that Mr. Romer would not himself
communicate to him the full nature of the hideous
bargain? The quarry-owner might think it diplomatic
to trade upon Maurice’s weakness.</p>

<p>No&mdash;there was no help for it. She must tell him;&mdash;only
praying now, in the profound depths of her
poor heart, that he would not consider such an infamy
even for a second. So she told him the whole story,
in a low monotonous voice, keeping her head lowered
and watching the progress of a minute snail laboriously
ascending a stalk of grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Maurice Quincunx had never twiddled the point of
his Elizabethan beard with more detached absorption
than while listening to this astounding narration.
When she had quite finished, he regarded her from
head to foot with a very curious expression.</p>

<p>The girl breathed hard. What was he thinking?
He did not at once, in a burst of righteous indignation,
fling the monstrous suggestion to the winds.
What was he thinking? As a matter of fact the
thoughts of Mr. Quincunx had taken an extraordinary
turn.</p>

<p>Being in his personal relation to feminine charm,
of a somewhat cold temper, he had never, for all his
imaginative sentiment towards his little friend, been
at all swayed by any violent sensuous attraction.
But the idea of such attraction having seized so
strongly upon another person reacted upon him, and
he looked at her, perhaps for the first time since
they had met, with eyes of something more than
purely sentimental regard.</p>

<p>This new element in his attitude towards her did
not, however, issue in any excess of physical jealousy.
What it did lead to, unluckily for Lacrima, was a
certain queer diminution of his ideal respect for her
personality. In place of focussing his attention upon
the sublime sacrifice she contemplated for his sake, the
events she narrated concentrated his mind upon the
mere brutal and accidental fact that Mr. Goring
had so desperately desired her. The mere fact of
her having been so desired by such a man, changed
her in his eyes. His cynical distrust of all women
led him to conceive the monstrous and grotesque idea
that she must in her heart be gratified by having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
aroused this passion in the farmer. It did not carry
him quite so far as to make him believe that she had
consciously excited such emotion; but it led him to
the very brink of that outrageous fantasy. Had
Lacrima come to him with a shame-faced confession
that she had let herself be seduced by the Priory-tenant
he could hardly have gazed at her with more
changed and troubled eyes. He felt the same curious
mixture of sorrowful pity and remote unlawful attraction
to the object of his pity, that he would have
felt in a casual conversation with some luckless child
of the streets. By being the occasion of Mr. Goring’s
passion, she became for him no less than such an
unfortunate; the purer sentiment he had hitherto
cherished changing into quite a different mood.</p>

<p>He lifted her up by the wrists and pressed her
closely to him, kissing her again and again. The
girl’s heart went on anxiously beating. She could
hardly restrain her impatience for him to speak.
Why did he not speak?</p>

<p>Disentangling herself from his embrace with a quick
feminine instinct that something was wrong, she
pulled him down upon the bench by her side and
taking his hand in hers looked with pitiful bewilderment
into his face.</p>

<p>“So when this thing happens,” she said, “all your
troubles will be over. You will be free forever from
that horrid office.”</p>

<p>“And you,” said Mr. Quincunx&mdash;his mood changing
again, and his goblin-like smile twitching his
nostrils,&mdash;“You will be the mistress of the Priory.
Well! I suppose you will not desert me altogether
when that happens!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>So that was the tone he adopted! He could afford
to turn the thing into a jest&mdash;into God knows what!
She let his hand drop and stared into empty space,
seeing nothing, hearing nothing, understanding nothing.</p>

<p>This time Maurice realized that he had disappointed
her; that his cynicism had carried him too far. Unfortunately
the same instinct that told him he had
made a fool of himself pushed him on to seek an
issue from the situation by wading still further into it.</p>

<p>“Come&mdash;come,” he said. “You and I must face
this matter like people who are really free spirits,
and not slaves to any ridiculous superstition. It is
noble, it is sweet of you to think of marrying that
brute so as to set me free. Of course if I <em>was</em> free,
and you were up at the Priory, we should see a great
deal more of each other than we do now. I could
take one of those vacant cottages close to the church.</p>

<p>“Don’t think&mdash;Lacrima dear,” he went on, possessing
himself of one of her cold hands and trying to
recall her attention, “don’t think that I don’t realize
what it is to you to have to submit to such a frightful
thing. Of course we know how outrageous it is
that such a marriage should be forced on you. But,
after all, you and I are above these absurd popular
superstitions about all these things. Every girl
sooner or later hates the man she marries. It is
human nature to hate the people we have to live
with; and when it comes down to actual reality, all
human beings are much the same. If you were
forced to marry me, you would probably hate me
just as much as you’ll hate this poor devil. After
all, what is this business of being married to people
and bearing them children? It doesn’t touch your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
mind. It doesn’t affect your soul. As old Marcus
Aurelius says, our bodies are nothing! They are
wretched corpses, anyway, dragged hither and thither
by our imprisoned souls. It is these damned clergymen,
with their lies about ‘sin’ and so forth, that
upset women’s minds. For you to be married to
a man you hate, would only be like my having
to go to this Yeoborough office with people I
hate. You will always have, as that honest fellow
Epictetus says, your own soul to retire into, whatever
happens. Heavens! it strikes me as a bit of
humorous revenge,”&mdash;here his nostrils twitched again
and the hobgoblin look reappeared&mdash;“this thought
of you and me living peacefully at our ease, so near
one another, and at these confounded rascals’
expense!”</p>

<p>Lacrima staggered to her feet. “Let me go,” she
said. “I want to go back&mdash;away&mdash;anywhere.”</p>

<p>Her look, her gesture, her broken words gave Mr.
Quincunx a poignant shock. In one sudden illuminating
flash he saw himself as he was, and his recent
remarks in their true light. We all have sometimes
these psychic search-light flashes of introspection;
but the more healthy-minded and well-balanced
among us know how to keep them in their place and
how to expel them promptly and effectively.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx was not healthy-minded. He had
the morbid sensitive mind of a neurotic Pariah.
Hence, in place of suppressing this spiritual illumination,
he allowed it to irradiate the gloomiest caverns
of his being. He rose with a look of abject and
miserable concern.</p>

<p>“Stop,” he cried huskily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at him wondering, the blood returning
a little to her cheeks.</p>

<p>“It is the Devil!” he exclaimed. “I must have
the Devil in me, to say such things and to treat you
like this. You are the bravest, sweetest girl in the
world, and I am a brutal idiot&mdash;worse than Mr.
Romer!”</p>

<p>He struck himself several blows upon the forehead,
knocking off his hat. Lacrima could not help noticing
that in place of the usual protection, some small
rhubarb-leaves ornamented the interior of this
appendage.</p>

<p>She smiled at him, through a rain of happy tears,&mdash;the
first smile that day had seen upon her face.</p>

<p>“We are both of us absurd people, I suppose,”
she said, laying her hands upon his shoulders. “We
ought to have some friend with a clear solid head to
keep us straight.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx kissed her on the forehead and
stooped down for his hat.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “We are a queer pair. I suppose
we are really both a little mad. I wish there was
someone we could go to.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you&mdash;perhaps&mdash;” said Lacrima, “say
something to Mrs. Seldom? And yet I would much
rather she didn’t know. I would much rather no
one knew!”</p>

<p>“I might,” murmured Maurice thoughtfully; “I
might tell her. But the unlucky thing is, she is so
narrow-minded that she can’t separate you in her
thoughts from those frightful people.”</p>

<p>“Shall I try Vennie?” whispered the girl, “or shall
we&mdash;” here she looked him boldly in the face with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
eager, brightening eyes&mdash;“shall we run away to
London, and be married, and risk the future?”</p>

<p>Poor little Italian! She had never made a greater
tactical blunder than when she uttered these words.
Maurice Quincunx’s mystic illumination had made
it possible for him to exorcise his evil spirit. It
could not put into his nature an energy he had not
been born with. His countenance clouded.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you’re saying,” he remarked.
“You don’t know what a sour-tempered
devil I am, and how I am sure to make any girl
who lives with me miserable. You would hate me
in a month more than you hate Mr. Romer, and in
a year I should have either worried you into your
grave or you would have run away from me. No&mdash;no&mdash;no!
I should be a criminal fool to let you
subject yourself to such a risk as that.”</p>

<p>“But,” pleaded the girl, with flushed cheeks, “we
should be sure to find something! I could teach
Italian,&mdash;and you could&mdash;oh, I am sure there are
endless things you could do! Please, please, Maurice
dear, let us go. Anything is better than this misery.
I have got quite enough money for the journey.
Look!”</p>

<p>She pulled out from beneath her dress a little
chain purse, that hung, by a small silver chain, round
her slender neck. She opened it and shook three
sovereigns into the palm of her hand. “Enough for
the journey,” she said, “and enough to keep us for
a week if we are economical. We should be sure to
find something by that time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx shook his head. It was an ironical
piece of psychic malice that the very illumination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
which had made him remorseful and sympathetic
should have also reduced to the old level of tender
sentiment the momentary passion he had felt. It
was the absence in him of this sensual impulse which
made the scheme she proposed seem so impossible.
Had he been of a more animal nature, or had she
possessed the power of arousing his senses to a more
violent craving, instead of brooding, as he did, upon
the mere material difficulties of such a plan, he would
have plunged desperately into it and carried her off
without further argument. The very purity of his
temperament was her worst enemy.</p>

<p>Poor Lacrima! Her hands dropped once more
helplessly to her side, and the old hopeless depression
began to invade her heart. It seemed impossible to
make her friend realize that if she refused the farmer
and things went on as before, her position in Mr.
Romer’s establishment would become more impossible
than ever. What&mdash;for instance&mdash;would become of
her when this long-discussed marriage of Gladys with
young Ilminster took place? Could she conceive
herself going on living under that roof, with Mr.
Romer continually harassing her, and his brother-in-law
haunting every field she wandered into?</p>

<p>“It was noble of you,” began her bearded friend
again, resuming his work at the weeds, while she, as
on a former occasion, leant against his wheel-barrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
“to think of enduring this wretched marriage
for my sake. But I cannot let you do it. I should
not be happy in letting you do it. I have some
conscience&mdash;though you may not think so&mdash;and
it would worry me to feel you were putting up with
that fool’s companionship just to make me comfortable.
It would spoil my enjoyment of my freedom,
to know that you were not equally free. Of
course it would be paradise to me to have the money
you speak of. I should be able to live exactly as I
like, and these damned villagers would treat me with
proper respect then. But I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t
take my pleasure at the expense of such a strain on
you. It would spoil everything!</p>

<p>“I don’t deny, however,” he went on, evidently
deriving more and more virtuous satisfaction from
his somewhat indecisive rejection of her sacrifice,
“that it is a temptation to me. I hate that office so
profoundly! You were quite right there, Lacrima.
All I said about getting on with those people was
damned bluff. I loathe them and they loathe me.
It is simply like a kind of death, my life in that
place. Yes, what you suggest is a temptation to me.
I can’t help feeling rather like that poor brother of
the girl in ‘Measure for Measure’ when she comes to
say that she could save his life by the loss of her
virtue, and he talks about his feelings on the subject
of death. She put him down fiercely enough, poor
dog! She evidently thought her virtue was much
more important than his life. I am glad you are
just the opposite of that puritanical young woman.
I shouldn’t like you very much if you took her line!</p>

<p>“But just because you don’t do that, my dear,”
Mr. Quincunx went on, tugging at the obstinate
roots of a great dock, “I couldn’t think of letting
you sacrifice yourself. If you <em>were</em> like that woman
in the play, and made all that damned silly fuss about
your confounded virtue, I should be inclined to wish
that Mr. Goring had got his hands upon you. Women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
who think as much of themselves as that, <em>ought</em> to be
given over to honest fellows like Mr. Goring. It’s the
sort of punishment they deserve for their superstitious
selfishness. For it’s all selfishness, of course. We
know that well enough!”</p>

<p>He flung the defeated weed so vindictively upon his
barrow that some of the earth from its roots was
sprinkled into Lacrima’s lap. He came to help her
brush it away, and took the opportunity to kiss her
again,&mdash;this time a shade more amorously.</p>

<p>“All this business of ‘love,’” he went on, returning
to his potatoes, “is nothing but the old eternal
wickedness of man’s nature. The only kind of love
which is worth anything is the love that gets rid of
sex altogether, and becomes calm and quiet and
distant&mdash;like the love of a planetary spirit. Apart
from this love, which is not like human love at all,
everything in us is selfish. Even a mother’s care for
its child is selfish.”</p>

<p>“I shall never have a child,” said Lacrima in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“I wonder what your friend James Andersen would
say to all this,” continued Mr. Quincunx. “Why, by
the way, don’t you get <em>him</em> to marry you? He would
do it, no doubt, like a shot, if you gave him a little
encouragement; and then make you work all day in
his kitchen, as his father made his mother, so they
say.”</p>

<p>Lacrima made a hopeless gesture, and looked at
the watch upon her wrist. She began to feel dizzy
and sick for want of food. She had had nothing
since breakfast, and the shadows were beginning to
grow long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know what Luke Andersen would say if we asked
him,” added Mr. Quincunx. “He would advise you
to marry this damned farmer, wheedle his money
out of him, and then sheer off with some fine youth
and never see Nevilton again! Luke Andersen’s the
fellow for giving a person advice in these little
matters. He has a head upon his shoulders, that
boy! I tell you what it is, my dear, your precious
Miss Gladys had better be careful! She’ll be getting
herself into trouble with that honest youth if she
doesn’t look out. I know him. He cares for no mortal
soul in the world, or above the world. He’s a
master in the art of life! We are all infants compared
with him. If you do need anyone to help you, or
to help me either, I tell you Luke Andersen’s the
one to go to. He has more influence in this village
than any living person except Romer himself, and I
should be sorry for Romer if his selfishness clashed
with the selfishness of that young Machiavel!”</p>

<p>“Do you mind,” said Lacrima suddenly, “if I go
into your kitchen and make myself a cup of tea?
I feel rather exhausted. I expect it is the heat.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx looked intently at her, leaning upon
his hoe. He had only once before&mdash;on an exceptionally
cold winter’s day&mdash;allowed the girl to enter
the cottage.</p>

<p>He had a vague feeling that if he did so he would
in some way commit himself, and be betrayed into
a false position. He almost felt as though, if she
were once comfortably established there, he would
never be able to get her out again! He was nervous,
too, about her seeing all his little household peculiarities.
If she saw, for instance, how cheaply, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
very cheaply, he managed to live, eating no meat
and economizing in sugar and butter, she might be
encouraged still further in her attempts to persuade
him to run away.</p>

<p>He was also strangely reluctant that she should
get upon the track of his queer little lonely epicurean
pleasures, such as his carefully guarded bottle of
Scotch whiskey; his favourite shelf of mystical and
Rabelaisian books; his jar of tobacco, with a piece
of bread under its lid, to keep the contents moist
and cool; his elaborate arrangements for holding
draughts out; his polished pewter; his dainty writing-desk
with its piled-up, vellum-bound journals, all
labelled and laid in order; his queer-coloured oriental
slippers; his array of scrupulously scrubbed pots and
pans. Mr. Quincunx was extremely unwilling that
his lady-love should poke her pretty fingers into all
these mysteries.</p>

<p>What he liked, was to live in two distinct worlds:
his world of sentiment with Lacrima as its solitary
centre, and his world of sacramental epicurism with
his kitchen-fire as its solitary centre. He was extremely
unwilling that the several circumferences of
these centres should intersect one another. Both
were equally necessary to him. When days passed
without a visit from his friend he became miserably
depressed. But he saw no reason for any inartistic
attempt to unite these two spheres of interest. A
psychologist who defined Mr. Quincunx’s temper as
the temper of a hermit would have been far astray.
He was profoundly dependent on human sympathy.
But he liked human sympathy that kept its place.
He did not like human <em>society</em>. Perhaps of all well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
psychological types, the type of the philosopher
Rousseau was the one to which he most
nearly approximated. And yet, had he possessed
children, Mr. Quincunx would certainly never have
been persuaded to leave them at the foundling
hospital. He would have lived apart from them,
but he would never have parted with them. He was
really a domestic sentimentalist, who loved the exquisite
sensation of being alone with his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>With all this in mind, one need feel no particular
surprise that the response he gave to Lacrima’s
sudden request was a somewhat reluctant one. However,
he did respond; and opening the cottage-doors
for her, ushered her into the kitchen and put the
kettle on the fire.</p>

<p>It puzzled him a little that she should feel no embarrassment
at being alone with him in this secluded
place! In the depths of his heart&mdash;like many
philosophers&mdash;Mr. Quincunx, in spite of his anarchistic
theories, possessed no slight vein of conventional
timidity. He did not realize this in the least.
Women, according to his cynical code, were the sole
props of conventionality. Without women, there
would be no such thing in the world. But now,
brought face to face with the reckless detachment of
a woman fighting for her living soul, he felt confused,
uncomfortable, and disconcerted.</p>

<p>Lacrima waited in patient passivity, too exhausted
to make any further mental or moral effort, while
her friend made the tea and cut the bread-and-butter.</p>

<p>As soon as she had partaken of these things, her
exhaustion gave place to a delicious sense&mdash;the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
she had known for many weeks&mdash;of peaceful and
happy security. She put far away, into the remote
background of her mind, all melancholy and tragic
thoughts, and gave herself up to the peacefulness of
the moment. The hands of Mr. Quincunx’s clock
pointed to half-past six. She had therefore a clear
thirty minutes left, before she need set out on her
return walk, in order to have time to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>“I wonder if your Miss Gladys,” remarked Lacrima’s
host, lighting a cigarette as he sipped his
tea, “will marry the Honourable Mr. Ilminster after
all, or whistle him down the wind, and make up to
our American friend? I notice that Dangelis is
already considerably absorbed in her.”</p>

<p>“Please, dear, don’t let us talk any more about
these people,” begged Lacrima softly. “Let me be
happy for a little while.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx stroked his beard. “You are a
queer little girl,” he said. “But what I should do
if the gods took you away from me I have not the
least idea. I should not care then whether I worked
in an office or in a factory. I should not care what
I did.”</p>

<p>The girl jumped up impulsively from her seat and
went over to him. Mr. Quincunx took her upon his
knees as he might have taken a child and fondled her
gravely and gently. The smoke of his cigarette
ascended in a thin blue column above their two
heads.</p>

<p>At that moment there was a mocking laugh at the
window. Lacrima slid out of his arms and they both
rose to their feet and turned indignantly.</p>

<p>The laughing face of Gladys Romer peered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
upon them, her eyes shining with delighted malevolence.
“I saw you,” she cried. “But you needn’t
look so cross! I like to see these things. I have been
watching you for quite a long time! It has been such
fun! I only hoped I could keep quiet for longer still,
till one of you began to cry, or something. But you
looked so funny that I couldn’t help laughing. And
that spoilt it all. Mr. Dangelis is at the gate.
Shall I call him up? He came with me across the
park. He tried to stop me from pouncing on you,
but I wouldn’t listen to him. He said it was a ‘low-down
stunt.’ You know the way he talks, Lacrima!”</p>

<p>The two friends stood staring at the intruder in
petrified horror. Then without a word they quickly
issued from the cottage and crossed the garden.
Neither of them spoke to Gladys; and Mr. Quincunx
immediately returned to his house as soon as he saw
the American advance to greet Lacrima with his
usual friendly nonchalance.</p>

<p>The three went off down the lane together; and the
poor philosopher, staring disconsolately at the empty
tea-cups of his profaned sanctuary, cursed himself,
his friend, his fate, and the Powers that had appointed
that fate from the beginning of the world.</p>

<span class="smaller">UNDER-CURRENTS</span></h2>

<p>June was drawing to an end, and the days,
though still free from rain, grew less and less
bright. A thin veil of greyish vapour, which
never became thick enough or sank low enough to
resolve itself into definite clouds, offered a perpetual
hindrance to the shining of the sun. The sun was
present. Its influence was felt in the warmth of the
air; but when it became visible, it was only in the
form of a large misty disc, at which the weakest
eyes might gaze without distress or discomfort.</p>

<p>On a certain evening when this vaporous obscurity
made it impossible to ascertain the exact moment of
the sun’s descent and when it might be said that
afternoon became twilight before men or cattle realized
that the day was over, Mr. Wone was assisting
his son Philip in planting geraniums in his back
garden.</p>

<p>The Wone house was neither a cottage nor a villa.
It was one of those nondescript and modest residences,
which, erected in the mid-epoch of Victoria’s reign,
when money was circulating freely among the middle-classes,
win a kind of gentle secondary mellowness
in the twentieth century by reason of something
solid and liberal in their original construction. It
stood at the corner of the upper end of Nevilton,
where, beyond the fountain-square, the road from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Yeoborough takes a certain angular turn to the north.
The garden at the back of it, as with many of the
cottages of the place, was larger than might have
been expected, and over the low hedge which separated
it from the meadows behind, the long ridge of
wooded upland, with its emphatic lines of tall Scotch
firs that made the southern boundary of the valley,
was pleasantly and reassuringly visible.</p>

<p>Philip Wone worked in Yeoborough. He was a
kind of junior partner in a small local firm of tombstone
makers&mdash;the very firm, in fact, which under
the direction of the famous Gideon, had constructed
the most remarkable monument in Nevilton churchyard.
It was doubtful whether he would ever attain
the position of full partner in this concern, for his
manner of life was eccentric, and neither his ways nor
his appearance were those of a youth who succeeds
in business. He was a tall pallid creature. His dark
coarse hair fell in a heavy wave over his white forehead,
and his hands were thin and delicate as the
hands of an invalid.</p>

<p>He was an omnivorous reader and made incessant
use of every subscription library that Yeoborough
offered. His reading was of two kinds. He read
romantic novels of every sort&mdash;good, bad, and indifferent&mdash;and
he read the history of revolutions.
There can hardly have been, in any portion of the
earth’s surface, a revolution with whose characters
and incidents Philip was unacquainted. His chief
passion was for the great French Revolution, the
personalities of which were more real to him than
the majority of his own friends.</p>

<p>Philip was by temperament and conviction an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
ardent anarchist; not an anarchist of Mr. Quincunx’s
mild and speculative type, but of a much more
formidable brand. He had also long ago consigned
the idea of any Providential interference with the
sequence of events upon earth, into the limbo of
outworn superstitions.</p>

<p>It was Philip’s notion, this, of planting geraniums
in the back-garden. Dressed nearly always in black,
and wearing a crimson tie, it was his one luxurious
sensuality to place in his button-hole, as long as
they were possibly available, some specimen or other
of the geranium tribe, with a preference for the most
flaming varieties.</p>

<p>The Christian Candidate regarded his son with a
mixture of contempt and apprehension. He despised
his lack of business ability, and he viewed his intellectual
opinions as the wilful caprices of a sulky and
disagreeable temper.</p>

<p>It was as a sort of pitying concession to the whim
of a lunatic that Mr. Wone was now assisting Philip
in planting these absurd geraniums. His own idea
was that flower-gardens ought to be abolished altogether.
He associated them with gentility and toryism
and private property in land. Under the régime
he would have liked to have established, all decent
householders would have had liberal small holdings,
where they would grow nothing but vegetables. Mr.
Wone liked vegetables and ate of them very freely in
their season. Flowers he regarded as the invention
of the upper classes, so that their privately owned
world might be decorated with exclusive festoons.</p>

<p>“I shall go round presently,” he said to his son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
“and visit all these people. I see no reason why
Taxater and Clavering, as well as the two Andersens,
should not make themselves of considerable use
to me. I am tired of talking to these Leo’s Hill
labourers. One day they <em>will</em> strike, and the next
they <em>won’t</em>. All they think of is their own quarrel
with Lickwit. They have no thought of the general
interest of the country.”</p>

<p>“No thought of your interests, you mean,” put in
the son.</p>

<p>“With these others it is different,” went on Mr.
Wone, oblivious of the interruption. “It would be
a real help to me if the more educated people of the
place came out definitely on my side. They ought
to do it. They know what this Romer is. They are
thinking men. They must see that what the country
wants is a real representative of the people.”</p>

<p>“What the country wants is a little more honesty
and a little less hypocrisy,” remarked the son.</p>

<p>“It is abominable, this suppression of our Social
Meeting. You have heard about that, I suppose?”
pursued the candidate.</p>

<p>“Putting an end to your appeals to Providence,
eh?” said Philip, pressing the earth down round the
roots of a brilliant flower.</p>

<p>“I forbid you to talk like that,” cried his father.
“I might at least expect that <em>you</em> would do something
for me. You have done nothing, since my
campaign opened, but make these silly remarks.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you pray about it?” jeered the irrepressible
young man. “Mr Romer has not suppressed
prayer, has he, as well as Political Prayer-Meetings?”</p>

<p>“They were not political!” protested the aggrieved
parent. “They were profoundly religious. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
you young people do not seem to realize nowadays
is that the soul of this country is still God-fearing
and religious-minded. I should myself have no hope
at all for the success of this election, if I were not
sure that God was intending to make His hand felt.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you canvass God, then?” muttered
the profane boy.</p>

<p>“I cannot allow you to talk to me in this way,
Philip!” cried Mr. Wone, flinging down his trowel.
“You know perfectly well that you believe as firmly
as I do, in your heart. It is only that you think it
impressive and original to make these silly jokes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, father,” replied Philip. “You certainly
remove my doubts with an invincible argument!
But I assure you I am quite serious. Nobody
with any brain believes in God in these days. God
died about the same time as Mr. Gladstone.”</p>

<p>The Christian Candidate lost his temper. “I must
beg you,” he said, “to keep your infidel nonsense to
yourself. Your mother and I are sick of it! You
had better stay in Yeoborough, and not come home
at all, if you can’t behave like an ordinary person
and keep a civil tongue.”</p>

<p>Philip made no answer to this ultimatum, but
smiled sardonically and went on planting geraniums.</p>

<p>But his father was loath to let the matter drop.</p>

<p>“What would the state of the country be like, I
wonder,” he continued, “if people lost their faith in
the love of a merciful Father? It is only because we
feel, in spite of all appearances, the love of God must
triumph in the end, that we can go on with our great
movement. The love of God, young man, whatever
you foolish infidels may say, is at the bottom of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
attempts to raise the people to better things. Do you
think I would labour as I do in this excellent cause
if I did not feel that I had the loving power of a
great Heavenly Father behind me? Why do I trouble
myself with politics? Because His love constrains
me. Why have I brought you up so carefully&mdash;though
to little profit it seems!&mdash;and have been so
considerate to your mother&mdash;who, as you know,
isn’t always very cheerful? Because His love constrains
me. Without the knowledge that His love
is at the bottom of everything that happens, do you
think I could endure to live at all?”</p>

<p>Philip Wone lifted up his head from the flower-border.</p>

<p>“Let me just tell you this, father, it is not the
love of God, or of anyone else, that’s at the bottom
of our grotesque world. There is nothing at the
bottom! The world goes back&mdash;without limit or
boundary&mdash;upwards and downwards, and everywhere.
It has no bottom, and no top either! It is
all quite mad and we are all quite mad. Love? Who
knows anything of love, except lovers and madmen?
If these Romers and Lickwits are to be crushed,
they must be crushed by force. By force, I tell
you! This love of an imaginary Heavenly Father has
never done anything for the revolution and never
will!”</p>

<p>Mr. Wone, catching at a verbal triumph, regained
his placable equanimity.</p>

<p>“Because, dear boy,” he remarked, “it is not
revolution that we want, but reconstruction. Force
may destroy. It is only love that can rebuild.”</p>

<p>No words can describe the self-satisfied unction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
with which the Christian Candidate pronounced this
oracular saying.</p>

<p>“Well, boy,” he added, “I must be off. I want to
see Taxater and Clavering and both the Andersens
tonight. I might see Quincunx too. Not that I
think <em>he</em> can do very much.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one way you’ll get James Andersen
to help you,” remarked Philip, “and I doubt whether
you’ll bring yourself to use that.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean,” returned his father, “that
Traffio girl, up at the House. I have heard that they
have been seen together. But I thought she was going
to marry John Goring.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean her,” said the son. “She’s all
right. She’s a fine girl, and I am sorry for her,
whether she marries Goring or not. The person I
mean is little Ninsy Lintot, up at Wild Pine. She’s
the only one in this place who can get a civil word
out of Jim Andersen.”</p>

<p>“Ninsy?” echoed his father, “but I thought Ninsy
was dead and buried. There was some one died up
at Wild Pine last spring, and I made sure ’twas her.”</p>

<p>“That was her sister Glory,” affirmed Philip. “But
Ninsy is delicate, too. A bad heart, they say&mdash;too
bad for any thoughts of marrying. But she and Jim
Andersen have been what you might call sweethearts
ever since she was in short frocks.”</p>

<p>“I have never heard of this,” said Mr. Wone.</p>

<p>“Nor have many other people here,” returned
Philip, “but ’tis true, none the less. And anyone
who wants to get at friend James must go to him
through Ninsy Lintot.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>
<p>“I am extremely surprised at what you tell me,”
said Mr. Wone. “Do you really mean that if I got
this sick child to promise me Andersen’s help, he
really would give it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I do,” replied Philip. “And what is
more, he would bring his brother with him.”</p>

<p>“But his brother is thick with Miss Romer. All
the village is talking about them.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the village&mdash;father! You think too
much of the village and its talk. I tell you&mdash;Miss
Romer or no Miss Romer&mdash;if you get James to help
you, you get Luke. I know something of the ways of
those two.”</p>

<p>A look of foxy cunning crossed the countenance of
the Christian Candidate.</p>

<p>“Do <em>you</em> happen to have any influence with this
poor Ninsy?” he asked abruptly, peering into his
son’s face.</p>

<p>Philip’s pale cheeks betrayed no embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I know her,” he said. “I like her. I lend her
books. She will die before Christmas.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would go up and see her for me then,”
said Mr. Wone eagerly. “It would be an excellent
thing if we <em>could</em> secure the Andersens. They must
have a lot of influence with the men they work with.”</p>

<p>Philip glanced across the rich sloping meadows
which led up to the base of the wooded ridge. From
where they stood he could see the gloomy clump of
firs and beeches which surrounded the little group of
cottages known as Wild Pine.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said. “I don’t mind. But no more
of this nonsense about my not coming home! I
prefer for the present”&mdash;and he gave vent to rather
an ominous laugh&mdash;“to live with my dear parents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
But, mind&mdash;I can’t promise anything. These Andersens
are queer fellows. One never knows how
things will strike them. However, we shall see. If
anyone could persuade our friend James, it would be
Ninsy.”</p>

<p>The affair being thus settled, the geraniums were
abandoned; and while the father proceeded down
the village towards the Gables, the son mounted
the slope of the hill in the direction of Wild Pine.</p>

<p>The path Philip followed soon became a narrow
lane running between two high sandy banks, overtopped
by enormous beeches. At all hours, and on
every kind of day, this miniature gorge between the
wooded fields was a dark and forlorn spot. On an
evening of a day like the present one, it was nothing
less than sinister. The sky being doubly dark above,
dark with the coming on of night, and dark with
the persistent cloud-veil, the accumulated shadows
of this sombre road intensified the gloom to a pitch
of darkness capable of exciting, in agitated nerves,
an emotion bordering upon terror. Though the sun
had barely sunk over Leo’s Hill, between these ivy-hung
banks it was as obscure as if night had already
fallen.</p>

<p>But the obscurity of Root-Thatch Lane was nothing
to the sombreness that awaited him when, arrived
at the hill-top, he entered Nevil’s Gully. This was
a hollow basin of close-growing beech-trees, surrounded
on both sides by impenetrable thickets of bramble
and elder, and crossed by the path that led to Wild
Pine cottages. Every geographical district has its
typical and representative centre,&mdash;some characteristic
spot which sums up, as it were, and focuses, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
limited bounds, qualities and attributes that are diffused
in diverse proportions through the larger area.
Such a centre of the Nevilton district was the place
through which Philip Wone now hurried.</p>

<p>Nevil’s Gully, however dry the weather, was never
free from an overpowering sense of dampness. The
soil under foot was now no longer sand but clay, and
clay of a particularly adhesive kind. The beech
roots, according to their habit, had created an empty
space about them&mdash;a sort of blackened floor, spotted
with green moss and pallid fungi. Out of this, their
cold, smooth trunks emerged, like silent pillars in the
crypt of a mausoleum.</p>

<p>The most characteristic thing, as we have noted,
in the scenery of Nevilton, is its prevalent weight
of heavy oppressive moisture. For some climatic or
geographical reason the foliage of the place seems
chillier, damper, and more filled with oozy sap, than
in other localities of the West of England. Though
there may have been no rain for weeks&mdash;as there
had been none this particular June&mdash;the woods in
this district always give one the impression of retaining
an inordinate reserve of atmospheric moisture.
It is this moisture, this ubiquitous dampness, that
to a certain type of sun-loving nature makes the
region so antipathetic, so disintegrating. Such persons
have constantly the feeling of being dragged
earthward by some steady centripedal pull, against
which they struggle in vain. Earthward they are
pulled, and the earth, that seems waiting to receive
them, breathes heavy damp breaths of in-drawing
voracity, like the mouth of some monster of the
slime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>And if this is true of the general conditions of
Nevilton geography, it is especially and accumulatively
true of Nevil’s Gully, which, for some reason
or other, is a very epitome of such sinister gravitation.
If one’s latent mortality feels the drag of its clayish
affinity in all quarters of this district, in Nevil’s
Gully it becomes conscious of such oppression as a
definite demonic presence. For above the Gully
and above the cottages to which the Gully leads, the
umbrageous mass of entangled leafiness hangs, fold
upon fold, as if it had not known the woodman’s
axe since the foot of man first penetrated these
recesses. The beeches, to which reference has been
made, are overtopped on the higher ground by ashes
and sycamores, and these, in their turn, are surmounted,
on the highest level of all, by colossal
Scotch firs, whose forlorn grandeur gives the cottages
their name.</p>

<p>Philip hurried, in the growing darkness, across the
sepulchral gully, and pushed open the gate of the
secluded cattle-yard which was the original cause of
this human hamlet. The houses of men in rural
districts follow the habitations of beasts. Where
cattle and the stacks that supply their food can
conveniently be located, there must the dwelling be
of those whose business it is to tend them. The
convenience of Wild Pine as a site for a spacious and
protected farm-yard was sufficient reason for the
erection of a human shelter for the hands by whose
labour such places are maintained.</p>

<p>He crossed the yard with quick steps. A light
burned in one of the sheds, throwing a fitful flicker
upon the heaps of straw and the pools of dung-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
water. Some animal, there&mdash;a horse or a
cow or a pig&mdash;was probably giving birth to young.</p>

<p>From the farm-yard he emerged into the cottage-garden,
and stumbling across this, he knocked at
the first door he reached. There was not the least
sound in answer. Dead unbroken stillness reigned,
except for an intermittent shuffling and stamping
from the watcher or the watched in the farm-yard
behind.</p>

<p>He knocked again, and even the sounds in the yard
ceased. Only, high up among the trees above him,
some large nocturnal bird fluttered heavily from
bough to bough.</p>

<p>For the third time he knocked and then the door
of the next house opened suddenly, emitting a long
stream of light into which several startled moths
instantly flew. Following the light came a woman’s
figure.</p>

<p>“If thee wants Lintot,” said the voice of this
figure, “thee can’t see ’im till along of most an hour.
He be tending a terrible sick beast.”</p>

<p>“I want to see Ninsy,” shouted Philip, knocking
again on the closed door.</p>

<p>“Then thee must walk in and have done with it,”
returned the woman. “The maid be laid up with
heart-spasms again and can open no doors this night,
not if the Lord his own self were hammering.”</p>

<p>Philip boldly followed her advice and entered the
cottage, closing the door behind him. A faint voice
from a room at the back asked him what he wanted
and who he was.</p>

<p>“It is Philip,” he answered, “may I come in and
see you, Ninsy? It is Philip&mdash;Philip Wone.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>He gathered from the girl’s low-voiced murmur that
he was welcome, and crossing the kitchen he opened
the door of the further room.</p>

<p>He found Ninsy dressed and smiling, but lying in
complete prostration upon a low horse-hair sofa. He
closed the door, and moving a chair to her side, sat
down in silence, gazing upon her wistfully with his
great melancholy eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so peaked and pining, Philip-boy,”
she said, laying her white hand upon his and smiling
into his face. “’Tis only the old trouble. ’Tis
nothing more than what I expect. I shall be about
again tomorrow or the day after. But I be real glad
to see ’ee here! Father’s biding down in the yard,
and ’tis a lonesome place to be laid-up in, this poor
old house.”</p>

<p>Ninsy looked exquisitely fragile and slender, lying
back in this tender helplessness, her chestnut-coloured
hair all loose over her pillow. Philip was filled with
a flood of romantic emotion. The girl had always
attracted him but never so much as now. It was
one of his ingrained peculiarities to find hurt and
unhappy people more engaging than healthy and
contented ones. He almost wished Ninsy would
stop smiling and chattering so pleasantly. It only
needed that she should shed tears, to turn the young
man’s commiseration into passion.</p>

<p>But Ninsy did not shed tears. She continued
chatting to him in the most cheerful vein. It was
only by the faintest shadow that crossed her face
at intervals, that one could have known that anything
serious was the matter with her. She spoke
of the books he had lent her. She spoke of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
probable break-up of the weather. She talked of
Lacrima Traffio.</p>

<p>“I think,” she said, speaking with extreme earnestness,
“the young foreign lady is lovely to look at.
I hope she’ll be happy in this marriage. They do say,
poor dear, she is being driven to it. But with the
gentry you never know. They aren’t like us. Father
says they have all their marriages thought out for
them, same as royalty. I wonder who Miss Gladys
will marry after all! Father has met her several
times lately, walking with that American gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Has Jim Andersen been up to see you, Ninsy,”
put in Mr. Wone’s emissary, “since this last attack
of yours?”</p>

<p>The fact that this question left his lips simultaneously
with a rising current of emotion in his heart
towards her is a proof of the fantastic complication
of feeling in the young anarchist.</p>

<p>He fretted and chafed under the stream of her
gentle impersonal talk. He longed to rouse in her
some definite agitation, even though it meant the
introduction of his rival’s image. The fact that such
agitation was likely to be a shock to her did not
weigh with him. Objective consideration for people’s
bodily health was not one of Philip’s weaknesses.
His experiment met with complete success. At the
mention of James Andersen’s name a scarlet flush
came into the girl’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes&mdash;no!” she answered stammering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
“That is&mdash;I mean&mdash;not since I have been ill. But
before&mdash;several times&mdash;lately. Why do you look
at me like that, Philip? You’re not angry with me,
are you?”</p>

<p>Philip’s mind was a confused arena of contradictory
emotions. Among the rest, two stood out and
asserted themselves&mdash;this unpardonable and remorseless
desire to trouble her, to embarrass her, to
make her blush yet more deeply&mdash;and a strange
wild longing to be himself as ill as she was, and of
the same disease, so that they might die together!</p>

<p>“My father wanted me to ask you,” he blurted
out, “whether you would use your influence over
Jim to get him to help in this election business. I
told my father Jim would do anything you asked
him.”</p>

<p>The girl’s poor cheeks burned more deeply than
ever at this.</p>

<p>“I wish you hadn’t told him that, Philip,” she
said. “I wish you hadn’t! You know very well I
have no more influence over James than anyone else
has. It was unkind of you to tell him that! Now
I am afraid he’ll be disappointed. For I shall never
dare to worry Jim about a thing like that. <em>You</em> don’t
take any interest in this election, Philip, do you?”</p>

<p>From the tone of this last remark the young anarchist
gathered the intimation that Andersen had been
talking about the affair to his little friend and had
been expressing opinions derogatory to Mr. Wone’s
campaign. She would hardly have spoken of so lively
a local event in such a tone of weary disparagement,
if some masculine philosopher had not been “putting
ideas into her head.”</p>

<p>“You ought to make him join in,” continued
Philip. “He has such influence down at the works.
It would be a great help to father. We labouring
people ought to stand by one another, you know.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;,” stammered poor
Ninsy, pushing back her hair from her forehead,
“that you had quite different opinions from Mr.
Wone.”</p>

<p>“Damn my opinions!” cried the excited youth.
“What do my opinions matter? We are talking of
Jim Andersen. Why doesn’t he join in with the
other men and help father in getting up the
strike?”</p>

<p>“He&mdash;he doesn’t believe in strikes,” murmured
the girl feebly.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he!” cried the youth. “Does he
think himself different, then, from the rest of us,
because old Gideon married the daughter of a vicar?
He ought to be told that he is a traitor to his class.
Yes&mdash;a traitor&mdash;a turn-coat&mdash;a black-leg! That’s
what he is&mdash;if he won’t come in. A black-leg!”</p>

<p>They were interrupted by a sharp knock at the
outer door. The girl raised herself on her elbow and
became distressingly agitated.</p>

<p>“Oh, I believe that <em>is</em> Jim,” she cried. “What shall
I do? He won’t like to find you here alone with me
like this. What a dreadful accident!”</p>

<p>Philip without a moment’s delay went to the door
and opened it. Yes, the visitor was James Andersen.
The two men looked at one another in silence. James
was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“So <em>you</em> are looking after our invalid?” he said.
“I only heard this afternoon that she was bad
again.”</p>

<p>He did not wait for the other’s response, but
pushing past him went straight into Ninsy’s room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor child!” he said, “Poor dear little girl!
Why didn’t you send a message to me? I saw your
father in the yard and he told me to come on in.
How are you? Why aren’t you in bed? I’m sure
you ought to be in bed, and not talking to such an
exciting person as our friend Philip.”</p>

<p>“She won’t be talking to me much longer,” threw
in that youth, following his rival to the side of the
girl’s sofa. “I only came to ask her to do something
for us in this election. She will tell you what I mean.
Ask her to tell you. Don’t forget! Good-bye
Ninsy,” and he held out his hand with a searching
look into the girl’s face, a look at once wistfully entreating
and fiercely reproachful.</p>

<p>She took his hand. “Good night, Philip,” she said.
“Think kindly of me, and think&mdash;” this was said
in a voice so low that only the young man could
hear&mdash;“think kindly of Jim. Good night!”</p>

<p>He nodded to Andersen and went off, a sombre
dangerous expression clouding the glance he threw
upon the clock in the corner.</p>

<p>“You pay late visits, James Andersen,” he called
back, as he let himself out of the cottage-door.</p>

<p>Left alone with Ninsy, the stone-carver possessed
himself of the seat vacated by the angry youth.
The girl remained quiet and motionless, her hands
crossed on her lap and her eyes closed.</p>

<p>“Poor child!” he murmured, in a voice of tender
and affectionate pity. “I cannot bear to see you like
this. It almost gives me a sense of shame&mdash;my being
so strong and well&mdash;and you so delicate. But you
will be better soon, won’t you? And we will go for
some of our old walks together.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Ninsy’s mouth twitched a little, and big tears
forced their way through her tightly shut eyelids.</p>

<p>“When your father comes in,” he went on, “you
must let me help him carry you upstairs. And I
am sure you had better have the doctor tomorrow
if you are not better. Won’t you let me go to Yeoborough
for him tonight?”</p>

<p>Ninsy suddenly struck the side of her sofa with
her clenched hand. “I don’t want the doctor!”
she burst out, “and I don’t want to get better. I
want to end it all&mdash;that’s what I want! I want to
end it all.”</p>

<p>Andersen made a movement as if to caress her, but
she turned her head away.</p>

<p>“I am sick and tired of it all,” she moaned. “I
wish I were dead. Oh, I wish I were dead!”</p>

<p>The stone-carver knelt down by her side. “Ninsy,”
he murmured, “Ninsy, my child, my friend, what is
it? Tell me what it is.”</p>

<p>But the girl only went on, in a low soft wail, “I
knew it would come to this. I knew it. I knew it.
Oh, why was I ever born! Why wasn’t it me, and not
Glory, who died! I <em>shall</em> die. I <em>want</em> to die!”</p>

<p>Andersen rose to his feet. “Ninsy!” he said in a
stern altered voice. “Stop this at once&mdash;or I shall
go straight away and call your father!”</p>

<p>He assumed an air and tone as if quieting a petulant
infant. It had its effect upon her. She swallowed
down her rising fit of sobs and looked up at
him with great frightened tearful eyes.</p>

<p>“Now, child,” he said, once more seating himself,
and this time successfully taking possession of a submissive
little hand, “tell me what all this is about.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Tell me everything.” He bent down and imprinted
a kiss upon her cold wet cheek.</p>

<p>“It is&mdash;” she stammered, “it is that I think you
are fond of that Italian girl.” She hid her face in a
fold of her rich auburn hair and went on. “They do
tell me you walk with her when your brother goes
with Miss Gladys. Don’t be angry with me, Jim.
I know I have no right to say these things. I know
I have no claim, no power over you. But we did
keep company once, Jim, didn’t us? And it do stab
my heart,&mdash;to hear them tell of you and she!”</p>

<p>James Andersen looked frowningly at the window.</p>

<p>The curtains were not drawn; and a dark ash-branch
stretched itself across the casement like an extended
threatening arm. Its form was made visible by a gap
in the surrounding trees, through which a little cluster
of stars faintly twinkled. The cloud veil had melted.</p>

<p>“What a world this is!” the stone-carver thought
to himself. His tone when he spoke was irritable and
aggrieved.</p>

<p>“How silly you are, Ninsy&mdash;with your fancies!
A man can’t be civil to a poor lonesome foreign
wench, without your girding at him as if he had done
something wrong! Of course I speak to Miss Traffio
and walk with her too. What else do you expect
when the poor thing is left lonesome on my hands,
with Luke and Miss Gladys amusing themselves?
But you needn’t worry,” he added, with a certain
unrestrained bitterness. “It’s only when Luke and
his young lady are together that she and I ever
meet, and I don’t think they’ll often be together
now.”</p>

<p>Ninsy looked at him with questioning eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>“He and she have quarrelled,” he said curtly.</p>

<p>“Over the American?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>“Over the American.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t be walking with that foreigner
any more?”</p>

<p>“I shan’t be walking with her any more.”</p>

<p>Ninsy sank back on her pillow with a sigh of ineffable
relief. Had she been a Catholic she would
have crossed herself devoutly. As it was she turned
her head smilingly towards him and extended her
arms. “Kiss me,” she pleaded. He bent down, and
she embraced him with passionate warmth.</p>

<p>“Then we belong to each other again, just the same
as before,” she said.</p>

<p>“Just the same as before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish that cruel doctor hadn’t told me I
mustn’t marry. He told father it would kill me, and
the other one who came said the same thing. But
wouldn’t it be lovely if you and I, Jim&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly, catching a glimpse of his
face. Her happiness was gone in a moment.</p>

<p>“You don’t love me. Oh, you don’t love me! I
know it. I have known it for many weeks! That girl
has poisoned you against me&mdash;the wicked, wicked
thing! It’s no use denying it. I know it. I feel it,&mdash;oh,
how can I bear it! How can I bear it!”</p>

<p>She shut her eyes once more and lay miserable and
silent. The wood-carver looked gloomily out of the
window. The cluster of stars now assumed a shape
well-known to him. It was Orion’s Belt. His
thoughts swept sadly over the field of destiny.</p>

<p>“What a world it is!” he said to himself. “There
is that boy Philip gone with a tragic heart because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
his girl loves me. And I&mdash;I have to wait and wait
in helplessness, and see the other&mdash;the one I care for&mdash;driven
into madness. And she cares not a straw for
me, who could help her, and only cares for that poor
fool who cannot lift a finger. And meanwhile,
Orion’s Belt looks contemptuously down upon us
all! Ninsy is pretty well right. The lucky people
are the people who are safe out of it&mdash;the people
that Orion’s Belt cannot vex any more!”</p>

<p>He rose to his feet. “Well, child,” he said, “I
think I’ll be going. It’s no use our plaguing one
another any further tonight. Things will right themselves,
little one. Things will right themselves! It’s
a crazy world&mdash;but the story isn’t finished yet.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about it,” he added gently,
bending over her and pushing the hair back from her
forehead. “Your old James hasn’t deserted you yet.
He loves you better than you think&mdash;better than
he knows himself perhaps!”</p>

<p>The girl seized the hand that caressed her and
pressed it against her lips. Her breast rose and fell
in quick troubled breathing.</p>

<p>“Come again soon,” she said, and then, with a wan
smile, “if you care to.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met in a long perplexed clinging farewell.
He was the first to break the tension.</p>

<p>“Good-night, child,” he said, and turning away,
left the room without looking back.</p>

<p>While these events were occurring at Wild Pine,
in the diplomatist’s study at the Gables Mr. Wone
was expounding to Mr. Taxater the objects and purposes
of his political campaign.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wotnot, leaner and more taciturn than ever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
had just produced for the refreshment of the visitor
a bottle of moderately good burgundy. Mr. Taxater
had demanded “a little wine,” in the large general
manner which his housekeeper always interpreted as
a request for something short of the very best. It
was clear that for the treasures of innermost wine-cellars
Mr. Wone was not among the privileged.</p>

<p>The defender of the papacy had placed his visitor
so that the light of the lamp fell upon his perspiring
brow, upon his watery blue eyes, and upon his drooping,
sandy-coloured moustache. Mr. Taxater himself
was protected by a carefully arranged screen, out of
the shadow of which the Mephistophelian sanctity of
his patient profile loomed forth, vague and indistinct.</p>

<p>Mr. Wone’s mission was in his own mind tending
rapidly to a satisfactory conclusion. The theologian
had heard him with so much attention, had asked
such searching and practical questions, had shown
such sympathetic interest in all the convolutions and
entanglements of the political situation, that Mr.
Wone began to reproach himself for not having made
use of such a capable ally earlier in the day.</p>

<p>“It is,” he was saying, “on the general grounds of
common Christian duty that I ask your help. We
who recognize the importance of religion would be
false to our belief if we did not join together to defeat
so ungodly and worldly a candidate as this
Romer turns out to be.”</p>

<p>It must be confessed that in his heart of hearts
Mr. Wone regarded Roman Catholics as far more
dangerous to the community than anarchists or
infidels, but he prided himself upon a discretion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
worthy of apostolic inspiration in thus seeking to
divide and set asunder the enemies of evangelical
truth. He found the papist so intelligent a listener,&mdash;that
hardly one secret of his political designs remained
unshared between them.</p>

<p>“The socialism,” he finally remarked, “which you
and I are interested in, is Christian Socialism. You
may be sure that in nothing I do or say there will be
found the least tincture of this deplorable modern
materialism. My own feeling is that the closer our
efforts for the uplifting of the people are founded
upon biblical doctrines the more triumphant their
success will be. It is the ethical aspect of this great
struggle for popular rights which I hold most near
my heart. I wish to take my place in Parliament
as representing not merely the intelligence of this
constituency but its moral and spiritual needs&mdash;its
soul, in fact, Mr. Taxater. There is no animosity
in my campaign. I am scrupulous about that. I am
ready, always ready, to do our opponents justice.
But when they appeal to the material needs of the
country, I appeal to its higher requirements&mdash;to its
soul, in other words. It is for this reason that I am
so glad to welcome really intelligent and highly educated
men, like yourself. We who take this loftier
view must of course make use of many less admirable
methods. I do so myself. But it is for us to keep
the higher, the more ethical considerations, always in
sight.</p>

<p>“As I was saying to my son, this very evening, the
grand thing for us all to remember is that it is only
on the assumption of Divine Love being at the bottom
of every confusion that we can go to work at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
The Tory party refuse to make this assumption.
They refuse to recognize the ethical substratum of
the world. They treat politics as if they were a
matter of merely imperial or patriotic importance.
In my view politics and religion should go hand in
hand. In the true democracy which I aim at establishing,
all these secular theories&mdash;evidently due to
the direct action of the Devil&mdash;such as Free Love
and the destruction of the family&mdash;will not be
tolerated for a moment.</p>

<p>“Let no one think,”&mdash;and Mr. Wone swallowed a
mouthful of wine with a gurgling sound,&mdash;“that
because we attack capitalism and large estates,
we have any wish to interfere with the sacredness of
the home. There are, I regret to say, among some
of our artizans, wild and dangerous theories of this
kind, but I have always firmly discountenanced them
and I always will. That is why, if I may say so,
I am so well adapted to represent this district. I
have the support of the large number of Liberal-minded
tradesmen who would deeply regret the introduction
of such immoral theories into our movement.
They hold, as I hold, that this unhappy tendency to
atheistic speculation among our working-classes is
one of the gravest dangers to the country. They hold,
as I hold, that the cynical free thought of the Tory
party is best encountered, not by the equally deplorable
cynicism of certain labor-leaders, but by the
high Christian standards of men like&mdash;like ourselves,
Mr. Taxater.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment and drew his hand, which
certainly resembled the hand of an ethical-minded
dispenser of sugar rather than that of an immoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
manual labourer, across his damp forehead. Then
he began again.</p>

<p>“Another reason which seems to point to me, in
quite a providential manner, as the candidate for
this district, is the fact that I was born in Nevilton
and that my father was born here before me.</p>

<p>“‘Wone’ is one of the oldest names in the church
Register. There were Wones in Nevilton in the days
of the Norman Conquest. I love the place&mdash;Mr.
Taxater&mdash;and I believe I may say that the place
loves me. I am in harmony with it, you know.
I understand its people. I understand their little
weaknesses. Some of these, though you may not
believe it, I even may say I share.</p>

<p>“I love this beautiful scenery, these luscious fields,
these admirable woods. I love to think of them as
belonging to us&mdash;to the people who live among them&mdash;I
love the voice of the doves in our dear trees,
Mr. Taxater. I love the cattle in the meadows. I
love the vegetables in the gardens. And I love to
think”&mdash;here Mr. Wone finished his glass, and
drew the back of his hand across his mouth&mdash;“I
love to think of these good gifts of the Heavenly
Father as being the expression of His divine bounty.
Yes, if anywhere in our revered country atheism and
immorality are condemned by nature herself, it is in
Nevilton. The fields of Nevilton are like the fields
of Canaan, they are full of the goodness of the Lord!”</p>

<p>“Your emotions,” said the Papal Apologist at last,
as his companion paused breathless, “do you credit,
my dear Sir. I certainly hold with you that it is
important to counteract the influence of Free-Thinkers.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the love of God, Mr. Taxater!” cried the
other, leaning forward and crossing his hands over
his knees. “We must not only refute, we must construct.”
Mr. Wone had never felt in higher feather.
Here was a man capable of really doing him justice.
He wished his recalcitrant son were present!</p>

<p>“Construct&mdash;that is what I always say,” he repeated.
“We must be creative and constructive in
our movement, and fix it firmly upon the Only Foundation.”</p>

<p>He surveyed through the window the expansive
heavens; and his glance encountered the same prominent
constellation, which, at that very moment,
but with different emotions, the agitated stone-carver
was contemplating from the cottage at Wild
Pine.</p>

<p>“You are undoubtedly correct, Mr. Wone,” said
his host gravely, using a tone he might have used
if his interlocutor had been recommending him to buy
cheese. “You are undoubtedly correct in finding
the basis of the system of things in love. It is no
more than what the Saints have always taught. I
am also profoundly at one with you in your objection
to Free Love. Love and Free Love are contradictory
categories. They might even be called antinomies.
There is no synthesis which reconciles them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wone had not the remotest idea what any of
these words meant, but he felt flattered to the
depths of his being. It was clear that he had been
led to utter some profound philosophical maxim.
He once more wished from his heart that his son
could hear this conversation!</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Taxater,” he said, “I must now leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
you. I have other distinguished gentlemen to call upon
before I retire. But I thank you for your promised
support.</p>

<p>“It would be better, perhaps”&mdash;here he lowered
his voice and looked jocose and crafty&mdash;“not to
refer to our little conversation. It might be misunderstood.
There is a certain prejudice, you know&mdash;unjustifiable,
of course, but unfortunately, very
prevalent, which makes it wiser&mdash;but I need say no
more. Good-bye, Mr. Taxater&mdash;good night, sir,
good night!”</p>

<p>And he bowed himself off and proceeded up the
street to find the next victim of his evangelical discretion.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone, Mr. Taxater summoned his
housekeeper.</p>

<p>“The next time that person comes,” he said, “will
you explain to him, very politely, that I have been
called to London? If this seems improbable, or if
he has caught a glimpse of me through the window,
will you please explain to him that I am engaged
upon a very absorbing literary work.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wotnot nodded. “I kept my eyes open yesterday,”
the old woman remarked, in the manner of
some veteran conspirator in the service of a Privy
Counsellor.</p>

<p>“As you happened to be looking for laurel-leaves,
I suppose?” said Mr. Taxater, drawing the red
curtains across the window, with his expressive
episcopal hand. “For laurel-leaves, Mrs. Wotnot, to
flavour that excellent custard?”</p>

<p>The old woman nodded. “And you saw?” pursued
her master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>“I saw Mr. Luke Andersen and Miss Gladys
Romer.”</p>

<p>“Were they as happy as usual&mdash;these young
people,” asked the theologian mildly, “or were they&mdash;otherwise?”</p>

<p>“They were very much what you are pleased to
call otherwise,” answered the old lady.</p>

<p>“Quarrelling in fact?” suggested the diplomat,
seating himself deliberately in his arm-chair.</p>

<p>“Miss Gladys was crying and Mr. Luke was
laughing.”</p>

<p>The Papal Apologist waved his hand. “Thank
you, Mrs. Wotnot, thank you. These things will
happen, won’t they&mdash;even in Nevilton? Mr. Luke
laughing, and Miss Gladys crying? Your laurel-leaves
were very well chosen, my friend. Let me
have the rest of that custard tonight! I hope you
have not brought back your rheumatism, Mrs. Wotnot,
by going so far?”</p>

<p>The housekeeper shook her head and retired to
prepare supper.</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater took up the book by his side and
opened it thoughtfully. It was the final volume of
the collected works of Joseph de Maistre.</p>

<p>Mr. Wone had not advanced far in the direction of
the church, when he overtook Vennie Seldom walking
slowly, with down-cast head, in the same direction.</p>

<p>Vennie had just passed an uncomfortable hour
with her mother, who had been growing, during the
recent days, more and more fretful and suspicious.
It was partly to allay these suspicions and partly
to escape from the maternal atmosphere that she had
decided to be present that evening at the weekly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
choir-practice, a function that she had found herself
lately beginning to neglect. Mr. Wone had forgotten
the choir-practice. It would interfere, he was afraid,
with his desired interview with Mr. Clavering. Vennie
assured him that the clergyman’s presence was
not essential at these times.</p>

<p>“He is not musical, you know. He only walks up
and down the aisle and confuses things. Everybody
will be glad if you take him away.”</p>

<p>She was a little surprised at herself, even as she
spoke. To depreciate her best friend in this flippant
way, and to such a person, showed that her nerves
were abnormally strained.</p>

<p>Mr. Wone did not miss the unusual tone. He had
never been on anything but very distant terms with
Miss Seldom, and his vanity was hugely delighted by
this new manner.</p>

<p>“I am coming into my own,” he thought to himself.
“My abilities are being recognized at last, by
all these exclusive people.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” he said, tentatively, “that you and your
dear mother are on our side in this great national
struggle. I have just been to see Mr. Taxater, and
he has promised me his energetic support.”</p>

<p>“Has he?” said Vennie in rather a startled voice.
“That surprises me&mdash;a little. I know he does not
admire Mr. Romer; but I thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“O he is with us&mdash;heart and soul with us!” repeated
the triumphant Nonconformist. “I am glad
I went to him. Many of us would have been too
narrow-minded to enter his house, seeing he is a
papist. But I am free from such bigotry.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>
<p>“And you hope to convert Mr. Clavering, too?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; that is what I intend. But I believe
our excellent vicar needs no conversion. I have
often heard him speak&mdash;at the Social Meeting, you
know&mdash;and I assure you he is a true friend of the
working-classes. I only wish more of his kind were
like him.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Clavering is too changeable,” remarked Vennie,
hardly knowing what she said. “His moods alter
from day to day.”</p>

<p>“But you yourself, dear Miss Seldom,” the candidate
went on. “You yourself are, I think, entirely
with us?”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know,” she answered. “My interests
do not lie in these directions. I sometimes
doubt whether it greatly matters, one way or the
other.”</p>

<p>“Whether it matters?” cried Mr. Wone, inhaling
the night-air with a sigh of protestation. “Surely,
you do not take that indifferent and thoughtless attitude?
A young lady of your education&mdash;of your
religious feeling! Surely, you must feel that it
matters profoundly! As we walk here together,
through this embalmed air, full of so many agreeable
scents, surely you must feel that a good and great
God is making his power known at last, known and
respected, through the poor means of our consecrated
efforts? Forgive my speaking so freely to one
of your position; but it seems to me that you must&mdash;you
at least&mdash;be on our side, simply because what
we are aiming at is in such complete harmony with
this wonderful Love of God, diffused through all
things.”</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the shrinking aversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
which these words produced upon the agitated nerves
of Vennie. Something about the Christian candidate
seemed to affect her with an actual sense of
physical nausea. She could have screamed, to feel
the man so near her&mdash;the dragging sound of his feet
on the road, the way he breathed and cleared his
throat, the manner in which his hat was tilted, all
combined to irritate her unendurably. She found
herself fantastically thinking how much sooner she
would have married even the egregious John Goring&mdash;as
Lacrima was going to do&mdash;than such a one as this.
What a pass Nevilton had brought itself to&mdash;when
the choice lay between a Mr. Romer and a Mr. Wone!</p>

<p>An overpowering wave of disgust with the whole
human race swept over her&mdash;what wretched creatures
they all were&mdash;every one of them! She mentally
resolved that nothing&mdash;nothing on earth&mdash;should
stop her entering a convent. The man talked of
agreeable odours on the air. The air was poisoned,
tainted, infected! It choked her to breathe it.</p>

<p>“I am so glad&mdash;so deeply glad,” Mr. Wone continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
“to have enjoyed the privilege of this little
quiet conversation. I shall never forget it. I feel as
though it had brought us wonderfully, beautifully,
near each other. It is on such occasions as this, that
one feels how closely, how entirely, in harmony, all
earnest-minded people are! Here are you, my dear
young lady, the descendant of such a noble and
ancient house, expressing in mute and tender silence,
your sympathy with one who represents the aspirations
of the poorest of the people! This is a symbolic
moment. I cannot help saying so. A symbolic
and consecrated moment!”</p>

<p>“We had better walk a little faster,” remarked
Miss Seldom.</p>

<p>“We will. We will walk faster,” agreed Mr. Wone.
“But you must let me put on record what this conversation
has meant to me! It has made me more
certain, more absolutely certain than ever, that without
a deep ethical basis our great movement is doomed
to hopeless failure.”</p>

<p>The tone in which he used the word “ethical” was
so irritating to Vennie, that she felt an insane longing
to utter some frightful blasphemy, or even indecency,
in his ears, and to rush away with a peal
of hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>They were now at the entrance to a narrow little
alley or lane which, passing a solitary cottage and an
unfrequented spring, led by a short approach directly
into the village-square. Half way down this lane a
curious block of Leonian stone stood in the middle of
the path. What the original purpose of this stone
had been it were not easy to tell. The upper portion
of it had apparently supported a chain, but
this had long ago disappeared. At the moment when
Mr. Wone and Miss Seldom reached the lane’s entrance,
a soft little scream came from the spot where
the stone stood; and dimly, in the shadowy darkness,
two forms became visible, engaged in some obscure
struggle. The scream was repeated, followed by a
series of little gasps and whisperings.</p>

<p>Mr. Wone glanced apprehensively in the direction
of these sounds and increased his pace. He was confounded
with amazement when he found that Vennie
had stopped as if to investigate further. The truth
is, he had reduced the girl to such a pitch of unnatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
revolt that, for one moment in her life, she felt
glad that there were flagrant and lawless pleasures in
the world.</p>

<p>Led by an unaccountable impulse she made several
steps up the lane. The figures separated as she approached,
one of them boldly advancing to meet her,
while the other retreated into the shadows. The
one who advanced, finding himself alone, turned and
called to his companion, “Annie! Where are you?
Come on, you silly girl! It’s all right.”</p>

<p>Vennie recognized the voice of Luke Andersen.
She greeted him with hysterical gratitude. “I
thought it was you, Mr. Andersen; but you did
frighten me! I took you for a ghost. Who is that
with you?”</p>

<p>The young stone-carver raised his hat politely.
“Only our little friend Annie,” he said. “I am escorting
her home from Yeoborough. We have been
on an errand for her mother. She’s such a baby,
you know, Miss Seldom, our little Annie. I love
teasing her.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you love teasing a great many people,
Mr. Andersen,” said Vennie, recovering her equanimity
and beginning to feel ashamed. “Here is Mr.
Wone. No doubt, he will be anxious to talk politics
to you. Mr. Wone!” She raised her voice as the
astonished Methodist came towards them. “It is
only Mr. Andersen. You had better talk to <em>him</em> of
your plans. I am afraid I shall be late if I don’t
go on.” She slipped aside as she spoke, leaving the
two men together, and hurried off towards the
church.</p>

<p>Luke Andersen shook hands with the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Candidate. “How goes the campaign, the great
campaign?” he said. “I wonder you haven’t talked
to James about it. James is a hopeless idealist.
James is an admirable listener. You really ought to
talk to James. I wish you <em>would</em> talk to him; and
put a little of your shrewd common-sense into him!
He takes the populace seriously&mdash;a thing you and I
would never be such fools as to do, eh, Mr. Wone?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid we disturbed you,” remarked the
Nonconformist, “Miss Seldom and I&mdash;I think you
had someone with you. Miss Seldom was quite interested.
We heard sounds, and she stopped.”</p>

<p>“Oh, only Annie”&mdash;returned the young man lightly,
“only little Annie. We are old friends you know.
Don’t worry about Annie!”</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful night, is it not?” remarked the
Methodist, peering down the lane. Luke Andersen
laughed.</p>

<p>“Are you by any chance, Mr. Wone, interested in
astronomy? If so, perhaps you can tell me the name
of that star, over there, between Perseus and Andromeda?
No, no; that one&mdash;that greenish-coloured
one! Do you know what that is?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea,” confessed the representative
of the People. “But I am a great admirer of
Nature. My admiration for Nature is one of the
chief motives of my life.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” said Luke. “It is one of my
own, too. I admire everything in it, without any
exception.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” said Mr. Wone, reverting to the purpose
that, with Nature, shared just now his dominant
interest, “I hope you are also with us in our struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
against oppression? Mr. Taxater and Miss Seldom
are certainly on our side. I sometimes feel as though
Nature herself, were on our side, especially on a
lovely night like this, full of such balmy odours.”</p>

<p>“I am delighted to see the struggle going on,” returned
the young man, emphatically. “And I am
thoroughly glad to see a person like yourself at the
head of it.”</p>

<p>“Then you, too, will take a part,” cried the candidate,
joyfully. “This, indeed, has been a successful
evening! I feel sure now that in Nevilton, at any
rate, the tide will flow strongly in my favour. Next
week, I have to begin a tour of the whole district.
I may not be able to return for quite a long time.
How happy I shall be to know that I leave the cause
in such good hands! The strike is the important
thing, Andersen. You and your brother must work
hard to bring about the strike. It is coming. I
know it is coming. But I want it soon. I want it
immediately.”</p>

<p>The stone-carver nodded and hummed a tune.
He seemed to intimate with the whole air of his
elegant quiescence that the moment had arrived for
Mr. Wone’s departure.</p>

<p>The Nonconformist felt the telepathic pressure of
this polite dismissal. He waved his arm. “Good
night, then; good night! I am afraid I must postpone
my talk with Mr. Clavering till another occasion.
Remember the strike, Andersen! That is what I
leave in your hands. Remember the strike!”</p>

<p>The noise of Mr. Wone’s retreating steps was
still audible when Luke returned to the stone in the
middle of Splash Lane. The sky was clear now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
and a faint whitish glimmer, shining on the worn
surface of the stone, revealed the two deep holes in
it, where the fastenings of the chain had hung.
The young man tapped the stone with his stick and
gave a low whistle. An amorphous heap of clothes,
huddled in the hedge, stirred, and emitted a reproachful
sound.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re there, are you?” he said. “What silly
nonsense is this? Get up! Let’s see your face!”
He stooped and pulled at the object. After a moment’s
struggle the flexible form of a young girl
emerged into the light. She held down her head and
appeared sulky and angry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Annie?” whispered the youth
encircling her with his arms.</p>

<p>The girl shook him away. “How could you tell
Miss Seldom who I was!” she murmured. “How
could you do it, Luke? If it had been anybody
else&mdash;but for her to know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The stone-carver laughed. “Really, child, you are
too ridiculous! Why, on earth, shouldn’t she know,
more than anyone else?”</p>

<p>The girl looked fiercely at him. “Because she is
good,” she said. “Because she is the only good
person in this blasted place!”</p>

<p>The young man showed no astonishment at this
outburst. “Come on, darling,” he rejoined. “We
must be getting you home. I daresay, Miss Seldom
is all you think. It seemed to me, though, that she
was different from usual tonight. But I expect that
fool had upset her.”</p>

<p>He let the young girl lean for a moment against
the shadowy stone while he fumbled for his cigarettes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
and matches. He observed her make a quick movement
with her hands.</p>

<p>“What are you up to now?” he asked.</p>

<p>She gave a fierce little laugh. “There!” she cried.
“I have done it!”</p>

<p>“What have you done?” he enquired, emitting a
puff of smoke, and throwing the lighted match into
the hedge.</p>

<p>She pressed her hands against the stone and looked
up at him mischievously and triumphantly. “Look!”
she said, holding out her fingers in the darkness. He
surveyed her closely. “What is it? Have you
scratched yourself?”</p>

<p>“Light a match and see!” she cried. He lit a
match and examined the hand she held towards him.</p>

<p>“You have thrown away that ring!”</p>

<p>“Not <em>thrown</em> it away, Luke; not thrown it away!
I have pressed it down into this hole. You can’t
get it out now! Nobody never can!”</p>

<p>He held the flickering match closely against the
stone’s surface. In the narrow darkness of the
aperture she indicated, something bright glittered.</p>

<p>“But this is really annoying of you, Annie,” said
the stone-carver. “I told you that ring was only
lent to me. She’ll be asking for it back tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can tell her to come here and get it!”</p>

<p>“But this is really serious,” protested Luke, trying
in vain to reach the object with his outstretched
fingers.</p>

<p>“And I have twisted my hair round it!” the girl
went on, in exulting excitement, “I have twisted it
tight around. It will be hard to get it off!”</p>

<p>Luke continued making ineffectual dives into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
hole, while she watched him gleefully. He went to
the hedge and breaking off a dusty sprig of woundwort
prodded the ring with its stalk.</p>

<p>“You can’t do it” she cried, “you can’t do it!
You’ll only push it further in!”</p>

<p>“Damn you, Annie!” he muttered. “This is a
horrible kind of joke. I tell you, Gladys will want
this confounded thing back tomorrow. She’s already
asked me twice for it. She only gave it to
me for fun.”</p>

<p>The girl leaned across the stone towards him,
propping herself on the palms of her hands, and
laughing mischievously. “No one in this village
can get that ring out of there!” she cried; “no one!
And when they does, they’ll find it all twisted up
with my hair!” She tossed back her black locks
defiantly.</p>

<p>Luke Andersen’s thoughts ran upon scissors, pincers,
willow-wands, bramble-thorns, and children’s
arms.</p>

<p>“Leave it then!” he said. “After all, I can swear
I lost it. Come on, you little demon!”</p>

<p>They moved away; and St. Catharine’s church
was only striking the hour of nine, when they separated
at her mother’s door.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">MORTIMER ROMER</span></h2>

<p>The incredibly halcyon June which had filled
the lanes and meadows of Nevilton that
summer with such golden weather, gave place
at last to July; and with July came tokens of a
change.</p>

<p>The more slow-growing hay-fields were still strewn
with their little lines of brown mown grass waiting
its hour of “carrying,” but the larger number of
the pastures wore now that freshly verdant and yet
curiously sad look, which fields in summer wear when
they have been shorn of their first harvest. The
corn in the arable-lands was beginning to stand high;
wheat and barley varying their alternate ripening
tints, from the rich gold of the one, to the diaphanous
glaucous green, so tender and pallid, of the
other. In the hedges, rag-wort, knapweed and scabious
had completely replaced wild-rose and elder-blossom;
and in the ditches and by the margins of ponds,
loosestrife and willow-herb were beginning to bud.
Even the latest-sprouting among the trees carried
now the full heavy burden, dark and monotonous, of
the summer’s prime; and the sharp, dry intermittent
chirping of warblers, finches and buntings, had long
since replaced, in the garden-bushes, the more flute-like
cries of the earlier-nesting birds.</p>

<p>The shadowy woods of the Nevilton valleys, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
their thick entangled undergrowth, were less pleasant
to walk in than they had been. Tall rank growths
choked the wan remnants of the season’s first prime;
and beneath sombre, indistinguishable foliage, the
dry, hard-trodden paths lost their furtive enchantment.
Dog-mercury, that delicate child of the under-shadows,
was no more now than a gross mass of
tarnished leaves. Enchanter’s night-shade took the
place of pink-campion; only to yield, in its turn,
to viper’s bugloss and flea-bane.</p>

<p>As the shy gods of the year’s tender birth receded
before these ranker maturings, humanity became
more prominent. Print-frocked maidens assisted the
sheep in treading the slopes of Leo’s Hill into earthy
grassless patches. Bits of dirty paper and the litter
of careless picnickers strewed the most shadowy
recesses. Smart youths flicked town-bought canes in
places where, a few weeks before, the squirrel had
gambolled undisturbed, and the wood-pecker had
deepened the magical silence by his patent labour.
Where recently, amid shadowy moss “soft as sleep,”
the delicate petals of the fragile wood-sorrel had
breathed untroubled in their enchanted aisles of
leafy twilight, one found oneself reading, upon
torn card-board boxes, highly-coloured messages to
the Human Race from energetic Tradesmen. July
had replaced June. The gods of Humanity had replaced
the gods of Nature; and the interlude between
hay-harvest and wheat-harvest had brought the
dog-star Sirius into his diurnal ascendance.</p>

<p>The project of Lacrima’s union with Mr. John
Goring remained, so to speak, “in the air.” The
village assumed it as a certainty; Mr. Quincunx regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
it as a probability; and Mr. Goring himself,
enjoying his yearly session of agreeable leisure,
meditated upon it day and night.</p>

<p>Lacrima had fallen into a curious lassitude with
regard to the whole matter. In these July days,
especially now that the sky was overcast by clouds
and heavy rains seemed imminent, she appeared to
lose all care or interest in her own life. Her mood
followed the mood of the weather. If some desperate
deluge of disaster was brooding in the distance, she
felt tempted to cry out, “Let it fall!”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx’s feelings on the subject remained a
mystery to her. He neither seemed definitely to
accept her sacrifice, nor to reject it. He did not
really&mdash;so she could not help telling herself&mdash;visualize
the horror of the thing, as it affected her, in any
substantial degree. He often made a joke of it;
and kept quoting cynical and worldly suggestions,
from the lips of Luke Andersen.</p>

<p>On the other hand, both from Mr. Romer and
the farmer, she received quiet, persistent and inexorable
pressure; though to do the latter justice,
he made no further attempts to treat her roughly or
familiarly.</p>

<p>She had gone so far once&mdash;in a mood of panic-stricken
aversion, following upon a conversation with
Gladys&mdash;as actually to walk to the vicarage gate,
with the definite idea of appealing to Vennie; but
it chanced that in place of Vennie she had observed
Mrs. Seldom moving among her flower-beds, and the
grave austerity of the aristocratic old lady had taken
all resolution from her and made her retrace her
steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>It must also be confessed that her dislike and fear
of Gladys had grown to dimensions bordering upon
monomania. The elder girl at once hypnotized and
paralyzed her. Her sensuality, her feline caprices,
her elaborately cherished hatred, reduced the Italian
to such helpless misery, that any change&mdash;even the
horror of this marriage&mdash;assumed the likeness of a
desirable relief.</p>

<p>It is also true that by gradual degrees,&mdash;for women,
however little prone to abstract thought, are quick
to turn the theories of those they love into living
practice,&mdash;she had come to regard the mere physical
terror of this momentous plunge as a less insurmountable
barrier than she had felt at first. Without
precisely intending it, Mr. Quincunx had really,
in a measure&mdash;particularly since he himself had come
to frequent the society of Luke Andersen&mdash;achieved
what might have conventionally been called the
“corruption” of Lacrima’s mind. She found herself
on several occasions imagining what she would really
feel, if, escaped for an afternoon from her Priory
duties, she were slipping off to meet her friend in
Camel’s Cover or Badger’s Bottom.</p>

<p>When the suggestion had been first made to her
of this monstrous marriage, it had seemed nothing
short of a sentence of death, and beyond the actual
consummation of it, she had never dreamed of
looking. But all this had now imperceptibly changed.
Many an evening as she sat with her work by Mrs.
Romer’s side, watching Gladys and her father play
cards, the thought came over her that she might
just as well enjoy the comparative independence of
having her own house and her own associations&mdash;even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
though the price of them <em>were</em> the society of
such a lump of clay&mdash;as live this wretched half-life
without hope or aim.</p>

<p>Other moods arrived when the thought of having
children of her own came to her with something more
than a mere sense of escape; came to her with the
enlargement of an opening horizon. She recalled the
many meandering discourses which Mr. Quincunx
had addressed to her upon this subject. They had
not affected her woman’s instincts; but they had
lodged in her mind. A girl’s children, so her friend
had often maintained, do not belong to the father
at all. The father is nothing&mdash;a mere irrelevant
incident, a mere chance. The mother alone&mdash;the
mother always&mdash;has the rights and pleasures, as
she has the responsibilities and pains of the parental
relation. She even recalled one occasion of twilight
philosophizing in the potato-bed, when Mr. Quincunx
had gone so far as to maintain the unscientific thesis
that children, born where there is no love, inherit
character, appearance, tastes, everything&mdash;from the
mother.</p>

<p>Lacrima had a dim suspicion that some of these
less pious theories were due to the perverse Luke,
who, as the cloudier July days overcast his evening
rambles, had acquired the habit of strolling at night-fall
into Mr. Quincunx’s kitchen. Once indeed she
was certain she discerned the trail of this plausible
heathen in her friend’s words. Mr. Quincunx, with
one of his peculiarly goblin-like leers, had intimated&mdash;in
jest indeed, but with a searching look into her face
that it would be no very difficult task to deceive,&mdash;in
shrewd Panurgian roguery, this clumsy clown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
His words at the time had hurt and shocked her;
and her reaction from them had led to the spoiling
of a pleasant conversation; but they invaded afterwards,
more deeply than she would have cared to
confess, her hours of dreamy solitude.</p>

<p>Her southern imagination, free from both the
grossness and the hypocrisy of the Nevilton mind,
was much readier to wander upon an antinomian
path&mdash;at least in its wayward fancies&mdash;than it
would have been, had circumstances not led her
away from her inherited faith.</p>

<p>While the sensuality of Gladys left her absolutely
untouched, the anarchistic theories of her friend&mdash;especially
now they had been fortified and directed
by the insidious Luke&mdash;gave her intelligence many
queer and lawless topics of solitary brooding. Her
senses, her instincts, were as pure and unsophisticated
as ever; but her conscience was besieged and threatened.
It was indeed a queer rôle&mdash;this, which fate
laid upon Mr. Quincunx&mdash;the rôle of undermining
the reluctance of his own sweetheart to make a
loveless marriage&mdash;but it was one for which his
curious lack of physical passion singularly fitted
him.</p>

<p>Had Vennie Seldom or Hugh Clavering been aware
of the condition of affairs they would have condemned
Mr. Quincunx in the most wholesale manner.
Clavering would probably have been tempted
to apply to him some of the most abusive language
in the dictionary. But it is extremely questionable
whether this judgment of theirs would have been
justified.</p>

<p>A more enlightened planetary observer, initiated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
into the labyrinthine hearts of men, might well have
pointed out that Mr. Quincunx’s theories were largely
a matter of pure speculation, humorously remote
from any contact with reality. He might also have
reminded these indignant ones that Mr. Quincunx
quite genuinely laboured under the illusion&mdash;if
it were an illusion&mdash;that for his friend to be mistress
of the Priory and free of her dependence on the
Romers was a thing eminently desirable, and worth
the price she paid for it. Such an invisible clairvoyant
might even have surmised, what no one in
Nevilton who knew of Mr. Romer’s offer would for
one second have believed; namely, that he would
have given her the same advice had there been no
such offer, simply on the general ground of binding
her permanently to the place.</p>

<p>The fact, however, remained, that by adopting this
ambiguous and evasive attitude Mr. Quincunx reduced
the more heroic and romantic aspect of the
girl’s sacrifice to the lowest possible level, and flung
her into a mood of reckless and spiritless indifference.
She was brought to the point of losing all interest
in her own fate and of simply relapsing upon the
tide of events.</p>

<p>It was precisely to this condition that Mr. Romer
had desired to bring her. When she had first attracted
him, and had fallen into his hands, there had
been certain psychological contests between them, in
which the quarry-owner had by no means emerged
victorious. It was the rankling memory of these
contests&mdash;contests spiritual rather than material&mdash;which
had issued in his gloomy hatred of her and his
longing to corrupt her mind and humiliate her soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
This corruption, this humiliation had been long in
coming. It had seemed out of his own power and
out of the power of his feline daughter to bring
it about; but this felicitous plan of using the
girl’s own friend to assist her moral disintegration
appeared to have changed the issue very completely.</p>

<p>Mr. Romer, watching her from day to day, became
more and more certain that her integral soul, the inmost
fortress of her self-respect, was yielding inch
by inch. She had flung the rudder down; and was
drifting upon the tide.</p>

<p>It might have been a matter of surprise to some
ill-judging psychologists that a Napoleonic intriguer,
of the quarry-owner’s type, should ever have entered
upon a struggle apparently so unequal and unimportant
as that for the mere integrity of a solitary
girl’s spirit. Such a judgment would display little
knowledge of the darker possibilities of human character.
Resistance is resistance, from whatever quarter
it comes; and the fragile soul of a helpless Pariah
may be just as capable of provoking the aggressive
instincts of a born master of men as the most obdurate
of commercial rivals.</p>

<p>There are certain psychic oppositions to our will,
which, when once they have been encountered, remain
indelibly in the memory as a challenge and a
defiance, until their provocation has been wiped out
in their defeat. It matters nothing that such oppositions
should spring from weak or trifling quarters.
We have been baffled, thwarted, fooled; and we cannot
recover the feeling of identity with ourselves,
until, like a satisfied tidal wave, our will has drowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
completely the barricades that defied it. It matters
nothing if at the beginning, what we were thwarted
by was a mere trifle, a straw upon the wind, a
feather in the breeze. The point is that our will, in
flowing outwards, at its capricious pleasure, met
with opposition&mdash;met with resistance. We do not
really recover our self-esteem until every memory of
such an event has been obliterated by a complete
revenge.</p>

<p>It is useless to object that a powerful ambitious
man of the Romer mould, contending Atlas-like under
a weight of enormous schemes, was not one to harbour
such long-lingering rancour against a mere Pariah.
There was more in the thing than appears on the
surface. The brains of mortal men are queer crucibles,
and the smouldering fires that heat them
are driven by capricious and wanton guests. Lacrima’s
old defeat of the owner of Leo’s Hill&mdash;a defeat
into which there is no need to descend now, for
its “terrain” was remote from our present stage&mdash;had
been a defeat upon what might be called a subliminal
or interior plane.</p>

<p>It was almost as if he had encountered her and she
had encountered him, not only in the past of this
particular life, but a remoter past&mdash;in a past of
some pre-natal incarnation. There are&mdash;as is well-known,
many instances of this unfathomable conflict
between certain human types&mdash;types that seem
to <em>find</em> one another, that seem to be drawn to one
another, by some preordained necessity in the occult
influences of mortal fate. It matters nothing in regard
to such a conflict, that on one side should be
strength, power and position, and on the other weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
and helplessness. The soul is the soul, and has
its own laws.</p>

<p>It is a case of what a true initiate into the secrets
of our terrestrial drama might entitle Planetary
Opposition. By some hidden law of planetary opposition,
this frail child of the Apennine ridges was
destined to provoke, to an apparently quite unequal
struggle, this formidable schemer from the money-markets
of London.</p>

<p>In these strange pre-natal attractions and repulsions
between men and women, the mere conventional
differences of rank and social importance
are as nothing and less than nothing.</p>

<p>Vast unfathomable tides of cosmic conflict drive us
all backwards and forwards; and if under the ascendance
of Sirius in the track of the Sun, the master
of Nevilton found himself devoting more energy to
the humiliation of his daughter’s companion than to
his election to the British Parliament, one can only
remember that both of them&mdash;the strong and the
weak&mdash;were merely puppets and pawns of elemental
forces, compared with which he, as well as she, was
as the chaff before the wind.</p>

<p>It was one of the peculiarities of this Nevilton
valley to draw to itself, as we have already
hinted, and focus strangely in itself, these airy and
elemental oppositions. To rise above the clash of
the Two Mythologies on this spot, with all their
planetary “auxiliar gods,” one would have had
to ascend incredibly high into that star-sown
space above&mdash;perhaps so high, that the whole
solar system, rushing madly through the ether
towards the constellation of Hercules, would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
shown itself as less than a cluster of wayward fireflies.
From a height as supreme as this, the difference
between Mortimer Romer and Lacrima Traffio would
have been less than the difference between two
summer-midges transacting their affairs on the edge
of a reed in Auber Lake.</p>

<p>Important or unimportant, however, the struggle
went on; and, as July advanced, seemed to tend
more and more to Mr. Romer’s advantage. Precisely
what he desired to happen was indeed happening&mdash;Lacrima’s
soul was disintegrating; her powers
of resistance were diminishing; and a reckless carelessness
about her personal fate was taking the place
of her old sensitive apprehensions.</p>

<p>Another important matter went well at this time
for Mr. Romer. His daughter became formally engaged
to the wealthy American. Dangelis had been
pressing her, for many weeks, to come to some
definite decision, between himself and Lord Tintinhull’s
heir, and she had at last made up her mind and
given him her promise.</p>

<p>The Romers were enchanted at this new development.
Mrs. Romer had always disliked the thought
of having to enter into closer relations with the
aristocracy&mdash;relations for which she was so obviously
unsuited; and Ralph Dangelis fitted in exactly with
her idea of what her son-in-law should be.</p>

<p>Mr. Romer, too, found in Dangelis just the sort of
son he had always longed for. He had quite recognized,
by this time, that the “artistic” tastes of the
American and his unusual talent interfered in no
way with the possession of a very shrewd intellectual
capacity. Dangelis had indeed all the qualities that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Mr. Romer most admired. He was strong. He was
clever. He was an entertaining companion. He was
at once very formidable and very good-tempered.
And he was immensely rich.</p>

<p>It would have annoyed him to see Gladys dominate
a man of this sort with her capricious ways.
But he had not the remotest fear that she would
dominate this citizen of Ohio. Dangelis would pet her
and spoil her and deluge her with money, but keep
a firm and untroubled hand over her; and that
exactly suited Mr. Romer’s wishes. The man’s
wealth would also be an immense help to himself in
his financial undertakings. Together they would be
able to engineer colossal and world-shaking schemes.</p>

<p>It was a satisfaction, too, to think that, when he
died, his loved quarries on Leo’s Hill and his historic
Leonian House should fall into the hands, not of these
Ilchesters and Ilminsters and Evershots&mdash;families
whose pretensions he hated and derided&mdash;but of an
honest descendant of plain business men of his own
class.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Romer, and not her husband, who
uttered a lament that the House after their death
should no longer be the property of one of their own
name. She proposed that Gladys’ American should be
induced to change his name. But Mr. Romer would
hear nothing of this. His system was the old imperial
Roman system, of succession by adoption.
The man who could deal with the Legions, the man
who was strong enough to suppress strikes on Leo’s
Hill, and cope successfully with such rascals as this
voluble Wone, was the man to inherit Nevilton!
Be his patronymic what you please, such a man was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
Cæsar. Himself, a new-comer, risen from nothing,
and contemptuous of all tradition, it had constantly
been a matter of serious annoyance to him that the
wealth he had amassed should only go to swell the
pride of these fatuous landed gentry. It delighted
him to think that Gladys’ children&mdash;the future inheritors
of his labour&mdash;should be, on their father’s
side also, from new and untraditional stock. It
gave him immense satisfaction to think of disappointing
Lord Tintinhull, who no doubt had long ago
told his friends how sad it was that his son had got
entangled with that girl at Nevilton; but how nice
it was that Nevilton House should in the future
take its proper place in the county.</p>

<p>There was one cloud on Mr. Romer’s horizon at
this moment, and that cloud was composed of vapours
spun from the brain of his parliamentary rival, the
eloquent Methodist.</p>

<p>Mr. Wone had long been at work among the Leo’s
Hill quarry-men, encouraging them to strike. Until
the second week in July his efforts had been fruitless;
but with the change in the weather to which we have
referred, the strike came. It had already lasted
some seven or eight days, when a Saturday arrived
which had been selected, several months before, for
a great political gathering on the summit of Leo’s
Hill. This was a meeting of radicals and socialists
to further the cause of Mr. Wone’s campaign.</p>

<p>Leo’s Hill had been, for many generations, the site
of such local gatherings. These gatherings were not
confined to political demonstrators. They were usually
attended by circus-men and other caterers to
proletarian amusement; and were often quite as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
lively, in their accompaniments of feasting and festivity,
as any country fair.</p>

<p>The actual speaking took place at the extreme
northern end of the hill, where there was a singular
and convenient feature, lending itself to such assemblies,
in the formation of the ground. This was the
grassy outline, still emphasizing quite distinctly its
ancient form, of the military Roman amphitheatre
attached to the camp. Locally the place was known
as “the Frying-pan”, from its marked and grotesque
resemblance to that utensil; but no base culinary
appellation, issue of Anglo-Saxon unimaginativeness,
could conceal the formidable classic moulding of
its well-known shape&mdash;the shape of the imperial
colisseum.</p>

<p>Between the Frying-pan and the southern side
of the hill, where the bulk of the quarries were, rose
a solitary stone building. One hardly expected the
presence of such a building in such a place, for it
was a considerable-sized inn; but the suitableness of
the grassy expanses of the ancient camp for all
manner of tourist-jaunts accounted for its erection;
and doubtless it served a good purpose in softening
with interludes of refreshment the labours of the
quarry-men.</p>

<p>It was the presence of this admirable tavern so
near the voice of the orator, that led Mr. Romer,
himself, to stroll, on that Saturday, in the direction
of his rival’s demonstration. Though the more considerable
of his quarries were at the southern end of
the hill, certain new excavations, in the success of
which he took exceptional interest, had been latterly
made in its very centre, and within a stone’s throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
of the tavern-door. The great cranes, used in this
new invasion, stood out against the sky from the
highest part of the hill, and assumed, especially at
sunset, when their shape was rendered most emphatic,
the form of enormous compasses, planted
there by some gigantic architectural hand.</p>

<p>It was in relation to these new works that Mr.
Romer, towards the close of the afternoon, found himself
advancing along the narrow path that led, between
clumps of bracken and furze-bushes, from the
most westward of his woods to the hill’s base. Mr.
Lickwit had informed him that there was talk,
among some of the more intransigent of the Yeoborough
socialists, about destroying these cranes.
Objections had been brought against them, in recent
newspaper articles, on purely æsthetic grounds. It
was said they disfigured the classic outline of the
hill, and interfered with a landmark which had been
a delight to every eye for unnumbered ages.</p>

<p>It was hardly to be supposed that the more official
of the supporters of Mr. Wone would condone any
such outbreak. It was unlikely that Wone himself
would do so. The “Christian Candidate,” as his
Methodist friends called him, was in no way a man
of violence. But the fact that there had been this
pseudo-public criticism of the works from an unpolitical
point of view might lend colour to any sort
of scandal. There were plenty of bold spirits among
the by-streets of Yeoborough who would have loved
nothing better than to send Mr. Romer’s cranes
toppling over into a pit, and indeed it was the sort
of adventure which would draw all the more restless
portion of the meeting’s audience. The possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
was the more threatening because the presence of
this kind of general fair attracted to the hill all
manner of heterogeneous persons quite unconnected
with the locality.</p>

<p>But what really influenced Mr. Romer in making
his own approach to the spot, was the neighbourhood
of the Half Moon. Where there was drink, he argued,
people would get drunk; and where people got drunk,
anything might happen. He had instituted Mr.
Lickwit to remain on guard at the eastern works;
and he had written to the superintendent of police
suggesting the advisability of special precautions.
But he felt nervous and ill at ease as he listened,
from his Nevilton terrace, to the distant shouts and
clamour carried to him on the west wind; and true
to his Napoleonic instincts, he proceeded, without
informing anyone of his intention, straight to the
zone of danger.</p>

<p>The afternoon was very hot, though there was no
sun. The wind blew in threatening gusts, and the
quarry-owner noticed that the distant Quantock
Moors were overhung with a dark bank of lowering
clouds. It was one of those sinister days that have
the power of taking all colour and all interest out of
the earth’s surface. The time of the year lent itself
gloomily to this sombre unmasking. The furze-bushes
looked like dead things. Many of them had
actually been burnt in some wanton conflagration;
and their prickly branches carried warped and
blighted seeds. The bracken, near the path, had been
dragged and trodden. Here and there its stalks protruded
like thin amputated arms. The elder-bushes,
caught in the wind, showed white and metallic, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
if all their leaves had been dipped in some brackish
water. All the trees seemed to have something of
this dull, whitish glare, which did not prevent them
from remaining, in the recesses of their foliage, as
drearily dark as the dark dull soil beneath them.
The grass of the fields had a look congruous with the
rest of the scene; a look as if it had been one large
velvety pall, drawn over the whole valley.</p>

<p>In the valley itself, along the edges of this grassy
hall, the tall clipped elm-trees stood like mourning
sentinels bowing towards their dead. Drifting butterflies,
principally of the species known as the
“Lesser Heath” and the “Meadow-Brown,” whirled
past his feet as he walked, in troubled and tarnished
helplessness. Here and there a weak dilapidated
currant-moth, the very epitome of surrender to circumstance,
tried in vain to arrest its enforced flight
among the swaying stalks of grey melancholy thistles,
the only living things who seemed to find the temper
of the day congenial with their own.</p>

<p>When he reached the base of the hill, Mr. Romer
was amazed at the crowd of people which the festivity
had attracted to the place. He had heard
them passing down the roads all day from the seclusion
of his garden, and to judge by such vehicles
as he had secured a glimpse of from the entrance to
his drive, many of them must have come from miles
away. But he had never expected a crowd like this.
It seemed to cover the whole northern side of the
hill, swaying to and fro, like some great stream of
voracious maggots, in the body of a dead animal.</p>

<p>Round the cranes, in the centre of the hill, the
crowd seemed especially thick. He made out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
presence there of several large caravans, and he heard
the music of a merry-go-round from that direction.
This latter sound, in its metallic and ferocious gaiety,
seemed especially adapted to the character of the
scene. It seemed like the very voice of some savage
Dionysian helot-feast, celebrated in defiance of all
constituted authority. It was such music as Caliban
would have loved.</p>

<p>Unwilling to arouse unnecessary anger by making
his presence known, while there was no cause, Mr.
Romer left the Half Moon on his right, and crossing
the brow of the hill diagonally, by a winding path
that encircled the grassy hollows of innumerable
ancient quarries, arrived at the foot of an immense
circular tumulus which dominated the whole scene.
This indeed was the highest point of Leo’s Hill, and
from its summit one looked far away towards the
Bristol Channel in one direction, and far away
towards the English Channel in another. It was, as
it were, the very navel and pivot of that historic
region. From this spot one obtained a sort of birds-eye
view of the whole surface of Leo’s Hill.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Romer found himself quite alone, and
from here, with hands clasped behind him, he surveyed
the scene with a grave satiric smile. He could
see his new works with the immense cranes reaching
into the sky above them. He could see the swaying
crowd round the amphitheatre at the extreme corner
of the promontory; and he could see, embosomed in
trees to the left of Nevilton’s Mount, a portion of
his own Elizabethan dwelling.</p>

<p>Mr. Romer felt strong and confident as he looked
down on all these things. He always seemed to renew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the forces of his being when he visited this grass-covered
repository of his wealth and influence. Leo’s
Hill suited his temper, and he felt as though he suited
the temper of Leo’s Hill. Between the man who
exploited the stone, and the great reservoir of the
stone he exploited, there seemed an illimitable affinity.</p>

<p>He looked down with grim and humorous contempt
at the noisy crowd thus invading his sacred domain.
They might harangue their hearts out,&mdash;those besotted
sentimentalists,&mdash;he could well afford to let
them talk! They might howl and dance and feast
and drink, till they were as dazed as Comus’ rabble,&mdash;he
could afford to let them shout! Probably Mr.
Wone, the “Christian Candidate,” was even at that
moment, making his great final appeal for election
at the hands of the noble, the free, the enlightened
constituency of Mid-Wessex.</p>

<p>Romer felt an immense wave of contempt surge
through his veins for this stream of fatuous humanity
as it swarmed before his eyes like an army of disturbed
ants. How little their anger or their affection
mattered to him&mdash;or mattered to the world at large!
He would have liked to have seized in his hands
some vast celestial torch and suffocated them all
in its smoke, as one would choke out a wasp’s nest.
Their miserable little pains and pleasures were not
worth the trouble Nature had taken in giving them
the gift of life. Dead or alive&mdash;happy or unhappy&mdash;they
were not deserving of any more consideration
than a cloud of gnats that one brushed away from
one’s face.</p>

<p>The master of Leo’s Hill drew a deep breath and
listened to the screams of the merry-go-round.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
Something in the strident machine made him think
of hymn-singing and mob-religion. This Religion of
Sentiment and Self-Pity with which they cloak their
weakness and their petty rancour&mdash;what is it, he
thought, but an excuse of escaping from the necessity
of being strong and fearless and hard and formidable?
It is easier&mdash;so much easier&mdash;to draw back, and
go aside, and deal in paltry subterfuges and sneaking
jealousies, veneered over with hypocritical unction,
than to strike out and pursue one’s own way drastically
and boldly.</p>

<p>He folded his arms and frowned. What is it, he
muttered to himself, this hidden Force, this Power,
this God, to which they raise their vague appeals
against the proud, clear, actual domination of natural
law and unscrupulous strength? Is there really some
other element in the world, some other fact, from
which they can draw support and encouragement?
There cannot be! He looked at the lowering sky
above him, and at the grey thistles and little patches
of thyme under his feet. All was solid, real, unyielding.
There was no gap, no open door, in the stark
surface of things, through which such a mystery might
enter.</p>

<p>He found himself vaguely wondering whose grave
this had originally been, this great flat tumulus, upon
which he stood and hated the mob of men. There
was a burnt circle in the centre of it, with blackened
cinders. The place had been used for some recent
national rejoicing, and they had raised a bonfire
here. He supposed that there must have been a
much more tremendous bonfire in the days when&mdash;perhaps
before the Romans&mdash;this mound was raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
to celebrate some savage chieftain. He wondered
whether, in his life-time, this long-buried, long-forgotten
one had stood, even as he stood now, and
cried aloud to the Earth and the Sky in sick loathing
of his wretched fellow-animals.</p>

<p>He humorously speculated whether this man also,
this ancient challenger of popular futility, had been
driven to strange excesses by the provocative resistance
of some feeble girl, making her mute appeals to
the suppressed conscience in him, and calling in the
help of tender compassionate gods? Had they softened
this buried chieftain’s heart, these gods of
slavish souls and weak wills, before he went down
into darkness? Or had he defied them to the last
and died lonely, implacable, contemptuous?</p>

<p>The quarry-owner’s ears began to grow irritated
at last by these raucous metallic sounds and by the
laughter and the shouting. It was so precisely as if
this foolish crowd were celebrating, in drunken ecstasy,
a victory won over him, and over all that was clear-edged,
self-possessed, and effectual, in this confused
world. He struck off the heads of some of the grey
thistles with his cane, and wished they had been the
heads of the Christian Candidate and his oratorical
associates.</p>

<p>Presently his attention was excited by a tremendous
hubbub at the northern extremity of the hill. The
crowd seemed to have gone mad. They cheered
again and again, and seemed vociferating some popular
air or some marching-song. He could almost
catch the words of this. The curious thing was that
he could not help in his heart dallying with the strange
wish that in place of being the man at the top, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
had been one of these men at the bottom. How differently
he would have conducted the affair. He knew,
from his dealings with the country families, how
deep this revolutionary rage with established tradition
could sink. He sympathized with it himself.
He would have loved to have flung the whole sleek
structure of society into disorder, and to have shaken
these feeble rulers out of their snug seats. But this
Wone had not the spirit of a wood-louse! Had he&mdash;Romer&mdash;been
at this moment the arch-revolutionary,
in place of the arch-tyrant, what a difference
in method and result! Did they think, these idiots,
that eloquent words and appeals to Justice and
Charity would change the orbits of the planets?</p>

<p>He strode impatiently to the edge of the tumulus.
Yes, there was certainly something unusual going
forward. The crowd was swaying outwards, was
scattering and wavering. Men were running to and
fro, tossing their hats in the air and shouting. At
last there really was a definite event. The whole
mass of the crowd seemed to be seized simultaneously
with a single impulse. It began to move. It began
to move in the direction of his new quarries. The
thrill of battle seized the heart of the master of
Nevilton with an exultant glow. So they were really
going to attempt something&mdash;the incapable sheep!
This was the sort of situation he had long cried out
for. To have an excuse to meet them, face to face,
in a genuine insurrection, this was worthier of a
man’s energy than quarrelling with wretched Social
Meetings.</p>

<p>He ran down the side of the tumulus and hastened
to meet the approaching mob. By leaving the path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
and skirting the edge of several disused quarries he
should, he thought, easily be able to reach his new
works long before they did. The tall cranes served
as a guide. To his astonishment he found, on approaching
his objective, that the mob had swerved,
and were now streaming forward in a long wavering
line, between the Half Moon tavern and the lower
slopes, towards the southern end of the hill.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he muttered under his breath, “this is more
serious! They are going to attack the offices.”</p>

<p>By this time, the bulk of the crowd had got so far
that it would have been impossible for him to intercept
or anticipate them.</p>

<p>Among the more cautious sight-seers who, mixed
with women and children, were trailing slowly in the
rear, he was quite certain he made out the figures of
Wone and his fellow-politicians. “Just like him,” he
thought. “He has stirred them up with his speeches
and now he is hiding behind them! I expect he will
be sneaking off home presently.” The figure he supposed
to be that of the Christian Candidate did,
as a matter of fact, shortly after this, detach himself
from the rest of his group and retire quietly and
discreetly towards the path leading to Nevilton.</p>

<p>Romer retraced his steps as rapidly as he could.
He repassed the tumulus, crossed a somewhat precipitous
bank between two quarries, and emerged
upon the road that skirts the western brow of the
hill. This road he followed at an impetuous pace,
listening, as he advanced, for any sound of destruction
and violence. When he arrived at the open
level between the two largest of his quarries he found
himself at the edge of a surging and howling mob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
He could see over their heads the low slate roofs of
his works, and he could see that someone, mounted
on a large slab of stone, was haranguing the people
near him, but more than this it was impossible to
make out and it was extremely difficult to get any
closer. The persons on the outskirts of the crowd
were evidently strangers, and with no interest in
the affair at all beyond excited curiosity, for he heard
them asking one another the most vague and confused
questions.</p>

<p>Presently he observed the figure of a policeman
rise behind the man upon the stone and jerk him to
the ground. This was followed by a bewildering
uproar. Clenched hands were raised in the air, and
wild cries were audible. He fancied he caught the
sound of the syllable “fire.”</p>

<p>Romer was seized with a mad lust of contest. He
struggled desperately to force his way through to
the front, but the entangled mass of agitated, perspiring
people proved an impassable barrier.</p>

<p>He began hastily summing up in his mind what
kind of destruction they could achieve that would
cause him any serious annoyance. He remembered
with relief that all the more delicate pieces of carved
work were down at Nevilton Station. They could
do little damage to solid blocks of stone, which were
all they would find inside those wooden sheds. They
might injure the machinery and the more fragile
of the tools, but they could hardly do even that,
unless they were aided by some of his own men. He
wondered if his own men&mdash;the men on strike&mdash;were
among them, or if the rioters were only roughs
from Yeoborough. Let them burn the sheds down!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
He did not value the sheds. They could be replaced
tomorrow. Their utmost worth was hardly the price
of a dozen bottles of champagne. It gave him a
thrill of grim satisfaction to think of the ineffectualness
of this horde of gesticulating two-legged creatures,
making vain assaults upon slabs of impervious rock.
Man against Stone! It was a pleasant and symbolic
struggle. And it could only have one issue.</p>

<p>Finding it impossible to move forward, and not
caring to be observed by anyone who knew him
hemmed in in this ridiculous manner among staring
females and jocose youths, Romer edged himself
backwards, and, hot and breathless, got clear of the
crowd.</p>

<p>The physical exhaustion of this effort&mdash;for only
a man of considerable strength could have advanced
an inch through such a dense mass&mdash;had materially
diminished his thirst for a personal encounter. He
smiled to himself to think how humorous it would
be if he could, even now, overtake the escaping Mr.
Wone, and offer his rival restorative refreshment, in
the cool shades of his garden! For the prime originals
of this absurd riot to be drinking claret-cup upon a
grassy lawn, while the misled and deluded populace
were battering their heads against the stony heart
of Leo’s Hill, struck Mr. Romer as a curiously suitable
climax to the days’ entertainment. Hardly
thinking of what he did, he clambered up the side of
a steep bank, where a group of children were playing,
and looked across the valley. Surely that solitary
black figure retreating so furtively, so innocently,
along the path towards the wood, could be no one
but the Christian Candidate!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Romer burst out laughing. The discreet fugitive
looked so absurdly characteristic in his shuffling
retirement, that he felt for the moment as if the
whole incident were a colossal musical-comedy farce.
A puff of smoke above the heads of the crowd, and
a smell of burning, made him serious again. “Damn
them!” he muttered. “They shall not get off without
anything being done.”</p>

<p>From his present position he was able to discern
how he could get round to the sheds. On their
remoter side he saw that the crowd had considerably
thinned away. He made out the figures of some
policemen there, bending, it appeared, over something
upon the ground.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to descend from his post,
to skirt the western side of the quarries, and to
reach the spot. He found that the object upon the
ground was no other than his manager Lickwit,
gasping and pallid, with a streak of blood running
down his face. From the policemen he learnt that
an entrance had been forced into the sheds, and the
more violent of the rioters&mdash;the ones who had laid
Mr. Lickwit low&mdash;were now regaling themselves in
that shelter upon the contents of a barrel of cider,
whose hiding-place someone had unearthed. The fire
was already trampled upon and extinguished. He
learnt further that a messenger had been sent to
summon more police to the spot, and that it was to
be hoped that the revellers within the shed would
continue their opportune tippling until their arrival.
This, however, was not what fate intended. Reeling
and shouting, the half-a-dozen joyous Calibans
emerged from their retreat and proceeded to address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
the people, all vociferating at the same time, and each
interrupting the other. The more official and respectable
among the politicians had either retired
altogether from the scene or were cautiously watching
it, from the safe obscurity of the general crowd, and
the situation around the stone-works was completely
in the hands of the rioters.</p>

<p>Mr. Romer, having done what he could for the
comfort of his manager, who was really more frightened
than hurt, turned fiercely upon the aggressors.
He commanded the two remaining policemen&mdash;the
third was helping Lickwit from the scene&mdash;to arrest
on the spot these turbulent ruffians, who were now
engaged in laying level with the ground a tool-shed
adjoining the one they had entered. They were
striking at the corner-beams of this erection with
picks and crow-bars. Others among the crowd, pushing
their less courageous neighbours forward, began
throwing stones at the policemen, uttering, as they
did so, yells and threats and abusive insults.</p>

<p>The mass of the people behind, hearing these
yells, and yielding to a steady pressure from the
rear, where more and more inquisitive persons kept
arriving, began to sway ominously onward, crowding
more and more thickly around the open space, where
Mr. Romer stood, angrily regarding them.</p>

<p>The policemen kept looking anxiously towards the
Half Moon where the road across the hill terminated.
They were evidently very nervous and extremely desirous
of the arrival of re-enforcements. No re-enforcements
coming, however, and the destruction
of property continuing, they were forced to act; and
drawing their staves, they made a determined rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
upon the men attacking the shed. Had these persons
not been already half-drunk, the emissaries of the
law would have come off badly. As it was, they
only succeeded in flinging the rioters back a few
paces. The whole crowd moved forward and a volley
of stones and sticks compelled the officials to retreat.
In their retreat they endeavoured to carry Mr. Romer
with them, assuring him, in hurried gasps, that his
life itself was in danger. “They’ll knock your head
off, sir&mdash;the scoundrels! Phil Wone has seen you.”</p>

<p>The pale son of Mr. Wone had indeed pushed his
way to the front. He at once began an impassioned
oration.</p>

<p>“There he is&mdash;the devil himself!” he shouted,
panting with excitement. “Do for him, friends!
Throw him into one of his own pits&mdash;the bloodsucker,
the assassin, the murderer of the people!”</p>

<p>Wild memories of historic passages rushed through
the young anarchist’s brain. He waved his arms
savagely, goading on his companions. His face was
livid. Mr. Romer moved towards him, his head
thrown back and a contemptuous smile upon his
face.</p>

<p>The drunken ring leaders, recognizing their hereditary
terror&mdash;the local magistrate&mdash;reeled backwards
in sudden panic. Others in the front line of the
crowd, knowing Mr. Romer by sight, stood stock still
and gaped foolishly or tried to shuffle off unobserved.
A few strangers who were there, perceiving the presence
of a formidable-looking gentleman, assumed at
once that he was Lord Tintinhull or the Earl of
Glastonbury and made frantic efforts to escape. The
crowd at the back, conscious that a reverse movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
had begun, became alarmed. Cries were raised
that the “military” had come. “They are going to
fire!” shouted one voice, and several women screamed.</p>

<p>Philip Wone lifted up his voice again, pointing
with outstretched arm at his enemy, and calling upon
the crowd to advance.</p>

<p>“The serpent!&mdash;the devil-fish!&mdash;the bread-stealer!&mdash;the
money-eater!” he yelled. “Cast him into his
own pit, bury him in his own quarries!”</p>

<p>It was perhaps fortunate for Mr. Romer at that
moment that his adversary was this honest youth
in place of a more hypocritical leader. An English
crowd, even though sprinkled with a leaven of angry
strikers, only grows puzzled and bewildered when
it hears its enemy referred to as “devil-fish” and
“assassin.”</p>

<p>The enemy at this moment took full advantage of
their bewilderment. He deliberately drew out his
cigarette-case and lighting a cigarette, made a gesture
as if driving back a flock of sheep. The crowd
showed further signs of panic. But the young anarchist
was not to be silenced.</p>

<p>“Look round you, friends,” he shouted. “Here is
this man defying you on the very spot where you
work for him day and night, where your descendants
will work for his descendants day and night! What
are you afraid of? This man did not make this hill
bring forth stone, though it is stone, instead of bread,
that he would willingly give your children!”</p>

<p>Mr. Romer gave a sign to the policemen and approached
a step nearer. The cider-drinkers had
already moved off. The crowd began to melt
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>“The very earth,” went on the young man, “cries
aloud to you to put an end to this tyranny! Do you
realize that this is the actual place where in one grand
revolt the men of Mid Wessex rose against the&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a man behind him&mdash;a
poacher from an outlying hamlet. “Chuck it, Phil
Wone! Us knows all about this ’ere job.”</p>

<p>Mr. Romer raised his hand. The policemen seized
the young man by the arms, one on either side. He
seemed hardly to notice them, and went on in a loud
resonant voice that rang across the valley.</p>

<p>“It will end! It will end, this evil day! Already
the new age is beginning. These robbers of the people
had better make haste with their plundering, for the
hour is approaching! Where is your priest?”&mdash;he
struggled violently with his captors, turning towards
the rapidly retreating crowd, “where is your vicar,&mdash;your
curer of souls? He talks to you of submission,
and love, and obedience, and duty. What does
this man care for these things? It is under this
talk of “love” that you are betrayed! It is under
this talk of “duty,” that your children have the
bread taken from their mouths! But the hour will
come;&mdash;yes, you may smile,” he addressed himself
directly to Mr. Romer now, “but you will not smile
for long. <em>Your</em> fate is already written down! It is
as sure as this rain,&mdash;as sure as this storm!”</p>

<p>He was silent, and making no further resistance,
let himself be carried off by the two officials.</p>

<p>The rain he spoke of was indeed beginning. Heavy
drops, precursors of what seemed likely to be a
tropical deluge, fell upon the broken wood-work, upon
the half-burnt bracken, upon the slabs of Leonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
stone, and upon the trampled grass. They also fell
upon Mr. Romer’s silver match-box as he selected
another cigarette of his favourite brand, and walked
slowly and smilingly away in the direction of Nevilton.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">HULLAWAY</span></h2>

<p>“I see,” said Luke Andersen to his brother, as they
sat at breakfast in the station-master’s kitchen,
about a fortnight after the riot on Leo’s Hill,
“I see that Romer has withdrawn his charge against
young Wone. It seems that the magistrates set him
free yesterday, on Romer’s own responsibility. So
the case will not come up at all. What do you make
of that?”</p>

<p>“He is a wiser man than I imagined,” said James.</p>

<p>“And that’s not all!” cried his brother blowing the
cigarette ashes from the open paper in front of him.
“It appears the strike is in a good way of being
settled by those damned delegates. We were idiots
to trust them. I knew it. I told the men so. But
they are all such hopeless fools. No doubt Romer
has found some way of getting round them! The
talk is now of arbitration, and a commissioner from
the government. You mark my words, Daddy Jim,
we shall be back working again by Monday.”</p>

<p>“But we shall get the chief thing we wanted, after
all&mdash;if Lickwit is removed,” said James, rising from
the table and going to the window, “I know I shall
be quite satisfied myself, if I don’t see that rascal’s
face any more.”</p>

<p>“The poor wretch has collapsed altogether, so they
said down at the inn last night,” Luke put in. “My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
belief is that Romer has now staked everything on
getting into Parliament and is ready to do anything
to propitiate the neighbourhood. If that’s his line,
he’ll succeed. He’ll out-manœuvre our friend Wone
at every step. When a man of his type once tries
the conciliatory game be becomes irresistible. That
is what these stupid employers so rarely realize. No
doubt that’s his policy in stopping the process
against Philip. He’s a shrewd fellow this Romer&mdash;and
I shouldn’t wonder if, when the strike is settled,
he became the most popular landlord in the country.
Wone did for himself by sneaking off home that day,
when things looked threatening. They were talking
about that in Yeoborough. I shouldn’t be surprised
if it didn’t lose him the election.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said James Andersen gazing out of
the window at the gathering clouds. “I should be
sorry to see that happen.”</p>

<p>“I should be damned glad!” cried his brother,
pushing back his chair and luxuriously sipping his
final cup of tea. “My sympathies are all with Romer
in this business. He has acted magnanimously.
He has acted shrewdly. I would sooner, any day,
be under the control of a man like him, than see a
sentimental charlatan like Wone get into Parliament.”</p>

<p>“You are unfair, my friend,” said the elder brother,
opening the lower sash of the window and letting in
such a draught of rainy wind that he was immediately
compelled to re-close it, “you are thoroughly unfair.
Wone is not in the least a charlatan. He believes
every word he says, and he says a great many things
that are profoundly true. I cannot see,” he went on,
turning round and confronting his equable relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
with a perturbed and troubled face, “why you have
got your knife into Wone in this extreme manner.
Of course he is conceited and long-winded, but the
man is genuinely sincere. I call him rather a pathetic
figure.”</p>

<p>“He looked pathetic enough when he sneaked off
after that riot, leaving Philip in the hands of the
police.”</p>

<p>“It annoys me the way you speak,” returned the
elder brother, in growing irritation. “What right
have you to call the one man’s discretion cowardice,
and the other’s wise diplomacy? I don’t see that it
was any more cowardice for Wone to protest against
a riot, than for Romer to back down before public
opinion as he seems now to have done. Besides,
who can blame a fellow for wanting to avoid a scene
like that? I know <em>you</em> wouldn’t have cared to encounter
those Yeoborough roughs.”</p>

<p>“Old Romer encountered them,” retorted Luke.
“They say he smoked a cigarette in their faces, and
just waved them away, as if they were a cloud of
gnats. I love a man who can do that sort of thing!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” cried the elder brother growing
thoroughly angry. “That’s the true Yellow Press
attitude! Here we have one of your ‘still, strong
men,’ afraid of no mob on earth! I know them&mdash;these
strong men! It’s easy enough to be calm and
strong when you have a banking-account like Romer’s,
and all the police in the county on your side!”</p>

<p>“Brother Lickwit will not forget that afternoon,”
remarked Luke, taking a rose from a vase on the
table and putting it into his button-hole.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lickwit is the scape-goat,” rejoined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
other. “Lickwit will have to leave the place, broken
in his nerves, and ruined in his reputation, while
his master gets universal praise for magnanimity
and generosity! That is the ancient trick of these
crafty oppressors.”</p>

<p>“Why do you use such grand words, Daddy Jim?”
said Luke smiling and stretching out his legs. “It’s
all nonsense, this talk about oppressors and oppressed.
The world only contains two sorts of people&mdash;the
capable ones and the incapable ones. I am all on the
side of the capable ones!”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is why you are treating little
Annie Bristow so abominably!” cried James, losing
all command of his temper.</p>

<p>Luke made an indescribable grimace which converted
his countenance in a moment from that of
a gentle faun to that of an ugly Satyr.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho!” he exclaimed, “so we are on that tack
are we? And please tell me, most virtuous moralist,
why I am any worse in my attitude to Annie, than
you in your attitude to Ninsy? It seems to me we
are in the same box over these little jobs.”</p>

<p>“Damn you!” cried James Andersen, walking
fiercely up to his brother and trembling with rage.</p>

<p>But Luke sipped his tea with perfect equanimity.</p>

<p>“It’s no good damning me,” he said quietly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
“That will not alter the situation. The fact remains,
that both of us have found our little village-girls
rather a nuisance. I don’t blame you. I don’t
blame myself. These things are inevitable. They are
part of the system of the universe. Little girls have
to learn&mdash;as the world moves round&mdash;that they
can’t have everything they want. I don’t know
whether you intend to marry Ninsy? I haven’t the
slightest intention of marrying Annie.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve been making love to her for the last
two months! You told me so yourself when we met
her at Hullaway!”</p>

<p>“And you weren’t so very severe then, were you,
Daddy Jim? It’s only because I have annoyed you
this morning that you bring all this up. As a matter
of fact, Annie is far less mad about me than Ninsy
is about you. She’s already flirting with Bob Granger.
Anyone can see she’s perfectly happy. She’s been
happy ever since she made a fool of me over Gladys’
ring. As long as a girl knows she’s put you in a
ridiculous position, she’ll very soon console herself.
No doubt she’ll make Granger marry her before the
summer’s over. Ninsy is quite a different person.
Annie and I take our little affair in precisely the same
spirit. I am no more to blame than she is. But
Ninsy’s case is different. Ninsy is seriously and
desperately in love with you. And her invalid state
makes the situation a much more embarrassing one.
I think my position is infinitely less complicated than
yours, brother Jim!”</p>

<p>James Andersen’s face became convulsed with
fury. He stretched out his arm towards his brother,
and extended a threatening fore-finger.</p>

<p>“Young man,” he cried, “I will <em>never</em> forgive you
for this!”</p>

<p>Having uttered these words he rushed incontinently
out of the room, and, bare-headed as he was, proceeded
to stride across the fields, in a direction opposite
from that which led to Nevilton.</p>

<p>The younger brother shrugged his shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
drained his tea-cup, and meditatively lit another
cigarette. The stone-works being closed, he had all
the day before him in which to consider this unfortunate
rupture. At the present moment, however,
all he did was to call their landlady&mdash;the station-master’s
buxom wife&mdash;and affably help her in the
removal and washing up of the breakfast things.</p>

<p>Luke was an adept in all household matters. His
supple fingers and light feminine movements were
equal to almost any task, and while occupied in such
things his gay and humorous conversation made any
companion of his labour an enviable person. Mrs.
Round, their landlady, adored him. There was
nothing she would not have done at his request; and
Lizzie, Betty, and Polly, her three little daughters,
loved him more than they loved their own father.
Having concerned himself for more than an hour with
these agreeable people, Luke took his hat and stick,
and strolling lazily along the railroad-line railings,
surveyed with inquisitive interest the motley group
of persons who were waiting, on the further side,
for the approach of a train.</p>

<p>A little apart from the rest, seated on a bench
beside a large empty basket, he observed the redoubtable
Mrs. Fringe. Between this lady and himself
there had existed for the last two years a sort
of conspiracy of gossip. Like many other middle-aged
women in Nevilton, Mrs. Fringe had made a
pet and confidant of this attractive young man, who
played, in spite of his mixed birth, a part almost
analogous to that of an affable and ingratiating
cadet of some noble family.</p>

<p>He passed through the turn-stile, crossed the track,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
and advanced slowly up the platform. His plump
Gossip, observing him afar off, rose and moved to
meet him, her basket swinging in her hand and a
radiant smile upon her face. It was like an encounter
between some Pantagruelian courtier and some colossal
Gargamelle. They stood together, in the wind,
at the extreme edge of the platform. Luke, who
was dressed so well that it would have been impossible
to distinguish him from any golden youth
from Oxford or Cambridge, whispered shameless
scandal into the lady’s ears, from beneath the shadow
of his panama-hat. She on her side was equally
confidential.</p>

<p>“There was a pretty scene down our way last
night,” she said. “Miss Seldom came in with some
books for my young Reverend and, Lord! they did
have an ado. I heard ’un shouting at one another
as though them were rampin’ mad. My master ’ee
were hollerin’ Holy Scripture like as he were dazed,
and the young lady she were answerin’ ’im with God
knows what. From all I could gather of it, that girl
had got some devil’s tale on Miss Gladys. ’Tweren’t
as though she did actually name her by name, as you
might say, but she pulled her hair and scratched her
like any crazy cat, sideways-like and cross-wise. It
seems she’d got hold of some story about that foreign
young woman and Miss Gladys having her knife into
’er, but I saw well enough what was at the bottom
of it and I won’t conceal it from ’ee, my dear. She
do want ’im for herself. That’s the long and short.
She do want ’im for herself!”</p>

<p>“What were they disputing about?” asked Luke
eagerly. “Did you hear their words?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Tis no good arstin’ me about their words,”
replied Mrs. Fringe. “Those long-windy dilly-dallies
do sound to me no more than the burbering of blowflies.
God save us from such words! I’m not a
reading woman and I don’t care who knows it. But
I know when a wench is moon-daft on a fellow. I
knows that, my dear, and I knows when she’s got a
tale on another girl!”</p>

<p>“Did she talk about Catholicism to him?” enquired
Luke.</p>

<p>“I won’t say as she didn’t bring something of that
sort in,” replied his friend. “But ’twas Miss Gladys
wot worried ’er. Any fool could see that. ’Tis my
experience that when a girl and a fellow get hot on
any of these dilly-dally argimints, there’s always
some other maid biding round the corner.”</p>

<p>“I’ve just had a row with James,” remarked the
stone-carver. “He’s gone off in a fury over towards
Hullaway.”</p>

<p>Mrs Fringe put down her basket and glanced up
and down the platform. Then she laid her hand on
the young man’s arm.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say what I do now say, to anyone, but
thee own self, dearie. And I wouldn’t say it to thee
if it hadn’t been worriting me for some merciful long
while. And what’s more I wouldn’t say it, if I didn’t
know what you and your Jim are to one another.
‘More than brothers,’ is what the whole village do
say of ye!”</p>

<p>“Go on&mdash;go on&mdash;Mrs. Fringe!” cried Luke.
“That curst signal’s down, and I can hear the train.”</p>

<p>“There be other trains than wot run on them
irons,” pronounced Mrs. Fringe sententiously, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
if you aren’t careful, one such God Almighty’s train
will run over that brother of yours, sooner or later.”</p>

<p>Luke looked apprehensively up the long converging
steel track. The gloom of the day and the ominous
tone of his old gossip affected him very unpleasantly.
He began to wish that there was not a deep muddy
pond under the Hullaway elms.</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean?” he cried, adding
impatiently, “Oh damn that train!” as a cloud of
smoke made itself visible in the distance.</p>

<p>“Only this, dearie,” said the woman picking up
her basket, “only this. If you listen to me you’d
sooner dig your own grave than have words with
brother. Brother be not one wot can stand these
fimble-fambles same as you and I. I know wot I
do say, cos I was privileged, under Almighty God,
to see the end of your dear mother.”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;I know&mdash;” cried the young man, “but
what do you mean?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fringe thrust her arm through the handle of
her basket and turned to meet the incoming train.</p>

<p>“’Twas when I lived with my dear husband down
at Willow-Grove,” she said. “’Twas a stone’s throw
there from where you and Jim were born. I always
feared he would go, same as she went, sooner or later.
He talks like her. He looks like her. He treats a
person in the way she treated a person, poor moon-struck
darling! ’Twas all along of your father. She
couldn’t bide him along-side of her in the last days.
And he knew it as well as you and I know it. But
do ’ee think it made any difference to him? Not a
bit, dearie! Not one little bit!”</p>

<p>The train had now stopped, and with various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
humorous observations, addressed to porters and
passengers indiscriminately, Mrs. Fringe took her
place in a carriage.</p>

<p>Heedless of being overheard, Luke addressed her
through the window of the compartment. “But
what about James? What were you saying about
James?”</p>

<p>“’Tis too long a tale to tell ’ee, dearie,” murmured
the woman breathlessly. “There be need now of all
my blessed wits to do business for the Reverend.
There, look at that!” She waved at him a crumpled
piece of paper. “Beyond all thinking I’ve got to
fetch him books from Slitly’s. Books, by the Lord!
As if he hadn’t too many of the darned things for his
poor brain already!”</p>

<p>The engine emitted a portentous puff of smoke, and
the train began to move. Luke walked by the side
of his friend’s window, his hand on the sash.</p>

<p>“You think it is inadvisable to thwart my brother,
then,” he said, “in any way at all. You think I
must humour him. You are afraid if I don’t&mdash;”
His walk was of necessity quickened into a run.</p>

<p>“It’s a long story, dearie, a long story. But I had
the privilege under God Almighty of knowing your
blessed mother when she was called, and I tell you it
makes my heart ache to see James going along the
same road as&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her voice was extinguished by the noise of wheels
and steam. Luke, exhausted, was compelled to relax
his hold. The rest of the carriages passed him with
accumulated speed and he watched the train disappear.
In his excitement he had advanced far beyond
the limits of the platform. He found himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
standing in a clump of yellow rag-wort, just behind
his own stone-cutter’s shed.</p>

<p>He gazed up the track, along which the tantalizing
lady had been so inexorably snatched away. The
rails had a dull whitish glitter but their look was
bleak and grim. They suggested, in their narrow
merciless perspective, cutting the pastures in twain,
the presence of some remorseless mechanical Will
carving its purpose, blindly and pitilessly, out of
the innocent waywardness of thoughtless living
things.</p>

<p>An immense and indefinable foreboding passed,
like the insertion of a cold, dead finger, through the
heart of the young man. Fantastic and terrible
images pursued one another through his agitated
brain. He saw his brother lying submerged in
Hullaway Pond, while a group of frightened children
stood, in white pinafores, stared at him with
gaping mouths. He saw himself arriving upon this
scene. He even went so far as to repeat to himself
the sort of cry that such a sight might naturally
draw from his lips, his insatiable dramatic sense
making use, in this way, of his very panic, to project
its irrepressible puppet-show. His brother’s words,
“Young man, I will never forgive you for this,”
rose luridly before him. He saw them written along
the edge of a certain dark cloud which hung threateningly
over the Hullaway horizon. He felt precisely
what he would feel when he saw them&mdash;luminously
phosphorescent&mdash;in the indescribable mud and greenish
weeds that surrounded his brother’s dead face.
A sickening sense of loss and emptiness went shivering
through him. He felt as though nothing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
world was of the least importance except the life of
James Andersen.</p>

<p>With hurried steps he recrossed the line, repassed
the turn-stile, and began following the direction
taken by his brother just two hours before. Never
had the road to Hullaway seemed so long!</p>

<p>Half-way there, where the road took a devious
turn, he left it, and entering the fields again, followed
a vaguely outlined foot-path. This also betraying
him, or seeming to betray him, by its departure
from the straight route, he began crossing the meadows
with feverish directness, climbing over hedges and
ditches with the desperate preoccupation of one
pursued by invisible pursuers. The expression upon
his face, as he hurried forward in this manner, was
the expression of a man who has everything he values
at stake. A casual acquaintance would never have
supposed that the equable countenance of Luke Andersen
had the power to look so haggard, so drawn,
so troubled. He struck the road again less than
half a mile from his destination. Why he was so
certain that Hullaway was the spot he sought, he
could hardly have explained. It was, however, one
of his own favourite walks on rainless evenings and
Sunday afternoons, and quite recently he had several
times persuaded his brother to accompany him. He
himself was wont to haunt the place and its surroundings,
because of the fact that, about a mile to
the west of it, there stood an isolated glove-factory
to which certain of the Nevilton girls were accustomed
to make their way across the field-paths.</p>

<p>Hullaway village was a very small place, considerably
more remote from the world than Nevilton, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
attainable only by narrow lanes. The centre of it
was the great muddy stagnant pond which now so
dominated Luke’s alarmed imagination. Near the
pond was a group of elms, of immense antiquity,&mdash;many
of them mere stumps of trees,&mdash;but all of
them possessed of wide-spreading prominent roots,
and deeply indented hollow trunks worn as smooth
as ancient household furniture, by the constant
fumbling and scrambling of generations of Hullaway
children.</p>

<p>The only other objects of interest in the place, were
a small, unobtrusive church, built, like everything
else in the neighborhood, of Leonian stone, and an
ancient farm-house surrounded by a high manorial
wall. Beneath one of the Hullaway Elms stood an
interesting relic of a ruder age, in the shape of some
well-worn stocks, now as pleasant a seat for rural
gossips as they were formerly an unpleasant pillory
for rural malefactors.</p>

<p>As Luke Andersen approached this familiar spot he
observed with a certain vague irritation the well-known
figure of one of his most recent Nevilton
enchantresses. The girl was no other, in fact, than
that shy companion of Annie Bristow who had been
amusing herself with them in the Fountain Square
on the occasion of Mr. Clavering’s ill-timed intervention.
At this moment she was sauntering negligently
along, on a high-raised path of narrow paved
flag-stones, such paths being a peculiarity of Hullaway,
due to the prevalence of heavy autumn floods.</p>

<p>The girl was evidently bound for the glove-factory,
for she swung a large bundle as she walked, resting
it idly every now and then, on any available wall or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
rail or close-cut hedge, along which she passed. She
was an attractive figure, tall, willowy, and lithe, and
she walked in that lingering, swaying voluptuous
manner which gives to the movements of maidens of
her type a sort of provocative challenge. Luke, advancing
along the road behind her, caught himself
admiring, in spite of his intense preoccupation, the
alluring swing of her walk and the captivating lines
of her graceful person.</p>

<p>The moment was approaching that he had so fantastically
dreaded, the moment of his first glance at
Hullaway Great Pond. He was already relieved to
see no signs of anything unusual in the air of the
place,&mdash;but the imaged vision of his brother’s
drowned body still hovered before him, and that
fatal “I’ll never forgive you for this!” still rang in
his ears.</p>

<p>His mind all this while was working with extraordinary
rapidity and he was fully conscious of the
grotesque irrelevance of this lapse into the ingrained
habit of wanton admiration. Quickly, in a flash of
lightning, he reviewed all his amorous adventures and
his frivolous philanderings. How empty, how bleak,
how impossible, all such pleasures seemed, without
the dark stooping figure of this companion of his
soul as their taciturn background! He looked at
Phyllis Santon with a sudden savage resolution, and
made a quaint sort of vow in the depths of his heart.</p>

<p>“I’ll never speak to the wench again or look at her
again,” he said to himself, “if I find Daddy Jim safe
and sound, and if he forgives me!”</p>

<p>He hurried past her, almost at a run, and arrived
at the centre of Hullaway. There was the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Pond, with its low white-washed stone parapet. There
were the ancient elm-trees and the stocks. There
also were the white-pinafored infants playing in the
hollow aperture of the oldest among the trees. But
the slimy surface of the water was utterly undisturbed
save by two or three assiduous ducks who at intervals
plunged beneath it.</p>

<p>He drew an immense sigh of relief and glanced
casually round. Phyllis had not failed to perceive
him. With a shy little friendly smile she advanced
towards him. His vow was already in some danger.
He waved her a hasty greeting but did not take her
hand.</p>

<p>“You’d better put yourself into the stocks,” he
said, covering with a smile the brutality of his neglect,
“until I come back! I have to find James.”</p>

<p>Leaving her standing in mute consternation, he
rushed off to the churchyard on the further side of
the little common. There was a certain spot here,
under the shelter of the Manor wall, where Luke
and his brother had spent several delicious afternoons,
moralizing upon the quaint epitaphs around them,
and smoking cigarettes. Luke felt as if he were
almost sure to find James stretched out at length
before a certain old tombstone whose queer appeal
to the casual intruder had always especially attracted
him. Both brothers had a philosophical mania for
these sepulchral places, and the Hullaway grave-yard
was even more congenial to their spirit than the
Nevilton one, perhaps because this latter was so
dominatingly possessed by their own dead.</p>

<p>Luke entered the enclosure through a wide-open
wooden gate and glanced quickly round him. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
was the Manor wall, as mellow and sheltering as
ever, even on such a day of clouds. There was their
favourite tombstone, with its long inscription to the
defunct seignorial house. But of James Andersen
there was not the remotest sign.</p>

<p>Where the devil had his angry brother gone?
Luke’s passionate anxiety began to give place to a
certain indignant reaction. Why were people so
ridiculous? These volcanic outbursts of ungoverned
emotion on trifling occasions were just the things
that spoiled the harmony and serenity of life.
Where, on earth, could James have slipped off to?
He remembered that they had more than once gone
together to the King’s Arms&mdash;the unpretentious
Hullaway tavern. It was just within the bounds
of possibility that the wanderer, finding their other
haunts chill and unappealing, had taken refuge
there.</p>

<p>He recrossed the common, waved his hand to
Phyllis, who seemed to have taken his speech quite
seriously and was patiently seated on the stocks, and
made his way hurriedly to the little inn.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;there, ensconced in a corner of the high settle,
with a half-finished tankard of ale by his side, was
his errant brother.</p>

<p>James rose at once to greet him, showing complete
friendliness, and very small surprise. He seemed to
have been drinking more than his wont, however,
for he immediately sank back again into his corner,
and regarded his brother with a queer absent-minded
look.</p>

<p>Luke ordered a glass of cider and sat down close
to him on the settle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he whispered, laying his hand on
his brother’s knee. “I didn’t mean to annoy you.
What you said was quite true. I treated Annie very
badly. And Ninsy is altogether different. You’ll
forgive me, won’t you, Daddy Jim?”</p>

<p>James Andersen pressed his hand. “It’s nothing,”
he said in rather a thick voice. “It’s like everything
else, it’s nothing. I was a fool. I am still a fool.
But it’s better to be a fool than to be dead, isn’t it?
Or am I talking nonsense?”</p>

<p>“As long as you’re not angry with me any longer,”
answered Luke eagerly, “I don’t care how you talk!”</p>

<p>“I went to the churchyard&mdash;to our old place&mdash;you
know,” went on his brother. “I stayed nearly
an hour there&mdash;or was it more? Perhaps it was
more. I stayed so long, anyway, that I nearly went
to sleep. I think I must have gone to sleep!” he
added, after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p>“I expect you were tired,” remarked Luke rather
weakly, feeling for some reason or other, a strange
sense of disquietude.</p>

<p>“Tired?” exclaimed the recumbent man, “why
should I be tired?” He raised himself up with a jerk,
and finishing his glass, set it down with meticulous
care upon the ground beside him.</p>

<p>Luke noticed, with an uncomfortable sense of
something not quite usual in his manner, that every
movement he made and every word he spoke seemed
the result of a laborious and conscious effort&mdash;like
the effort of one in incomplete control of his sensory
nerves.</p>

<p>“What shall we do now?” said Luke with an air
of ease and indifference. “Do you feel like strolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
back to Nevilton, or shall we make a day of it and
go on to Roger-Town Ferry and have dinner there?”</p>

<p>James gave vent to a curiously unpleasant laugh.
“You go, my dear,” he said, “and leave me where
I am.”</p>

<p>Luke began to feel thoroughly uncomfortable. He
once more laid his hand caressingly on his brother’s
knee. “You have really forgiven me?” he pleaded.
“Really and truly?”</p>

<p>James Andersen had again sunk back into a semi-comatose
state in his corner. “Forgive?” he muttered,
as though he found difficulty in understanding
the meaning of the word, “forgive? I tell you it’s
nothing.”</p>

<p>He was silent, and then, in a still more drowsy
murmur, he uttered the word “Nothing” three or
four times. Soon after this he closed his eyes and
relapsed into a deep slumber.</p>

<p>“Better leave ’un as ’un be,” remarked the landlord
to Luke. “I’ve had my eye on ’un for this last
’arf hour. ’A do seem mazed-like, looks so. Let ’un
bide where ’un be, master. These be wonderful
rumbly days for a man’s head. ’Taint what ’ee’s
’ad, you understand; to my thinking, ’tis these thunder-shocks
wot ’ave worrited ’im.”</p>

<p>Luke nodded at the man, and standing up surveyed
his brother gravely. It certainly looked as if
James was settled in his corner for the rest of the
morning. Luke wondered if it would be best to let
him remain where he was, and sleep off his coma, or
to rouse him and try and persuade him to return
home. He decided to take the landlord’s advice.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said. “I’ll just leave him for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
while to recover himself. You’ll keep an eye to
him, won’t you, Mr. Titley? I’ll just wander round a
bit, and come back. May-be if he doesn’t want to
go home to dinner, we’ll have a bite of something
here with you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Titley promised not to let his guest out of his
sight. “I know what these thunder-shocks be,” he
said. “Don’t you worry, mister. You’ll find ’un
wonderful reasonable along of an hour or so. ’Tis
the weather wot ’ave him floored ’im. The liquor
’ee’s put down wouldn’t hurt a cat.”</p>

<p>Luke threw an affectionate glance at his brother’s
reclining figure and went out. The reaction from his
exaggerated anxiety left him listless and unnerved.
He walked slowly across the green, towards the group
of elms.</p>

<p>It was now past noon and the small children who
had been loitering under the trees had been carried
off to their mid-day meal. The place seemed entirely
deserted, except for the voracious ducks in the
mud of the Great Pond. He fancied at first that
Phyllis Santon had disappeared with the children, and
a queer feeling of disappointment descended upon
him. He would have liked at least to have had the
opportunity of <em>refusing</em> himself the pleasure of talking
to her! He approached the enormous elm under
which stood the stocks. Ah! She was still there
then, his little Nevilton acquaintance. He had not
seen her sooner, because she was seated on the lowest
roots of the tree, her knees against the stocks themselves.</p>

<p>“Hullo, child!” he found himself saying, while his
inner consciousness told itself that he would just say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
one word to her, so that her feelings should not be
hurt, and then stroll off to the churchyard. “Why,
you have fixed yourself in the very place where they
used to make people sit, when they put them in the
stocks!”</p>

<p>“Have I?” said the girl looking up at him without
moving. “’Tis curious to think of them days! They
do say folks never tasted meat nor butter in them
old times. I guess it’s better to be living as we be.”</p>

<p>Luke’s habitual tone of sentimental moralizing had
evidently set the fashion among the maids of Nevilton.
Girls are incredibly quick at acquiring the mental
atmosphere of a philosopher who attracts them. The
simple flattery of her adoption of his colour of thought
made it still more difficult for Luke to keep his vow
to the Spinners of Destiny.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he remarked pensively, seating himself on
the stocks above her. “It is extraordinary, isn’t it,
to think how many generations of people, like you
and me, have talked to one another here, in fine days
and cloudy days, in winter and summer&mdash;and the
same old pond and the same old elms listening to
all they say?”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Luke dear,” protested the girl,
with a little apprehensive movement of her shoulders,
and a tightened clasp of her hands round her knees.
“I don’t like to think of that! ’Tis lonesome enough
in this place, mid-day, without thinking of them
ghost-stories.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say ghost-stories?” inquired Luke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
“There’s nothing ghostly about that dirty old pond
and there’s nothing ghostly about these hollow trees&mdash;not
now, any way.”</p>

<p>“’Tis what you said about their listening, that
seems ghostly-like to me,” replied the girl. “I am
always like that, you know. Sometimes, down home,
I gets a grip of the terrors from staring at old Mr.
Pratty’s barn. ’Tis funny, isn’t it? I suppose I was
born along of Christmas. They say children born
then are wonderful ones for fancying things.”</p>

<p>Luke prodded the ground with his cane and looked
at her in silence. Conscious of a certain admiration
in his look, for the awkwardness of her pose
only enhanced the magnetic charm of her person,
she proceeded to remove her hat and lean her head
with a wistful abandonment against the rough bark
of the tree.</p>

<p>The clouds hung heavily over them, and it seemed
that at any moment the rain might descend in
torrents; but so far not a drop had fallen. Queer
and mysterious emotions passed through Luke’s
mind.</p>

<p>He felt in some odd way that he was at a turning-point
in the tide of his existence. It almost seemed
to him as though, silent and unmoving, under the
roof of the little inn which he could see from where
he sat, his brother was lying in the crisis of some
dangerous fever. A movement, or gesture, or word,
from himself might precipitate this crisis, in one
direction or the other.</p>

<p>The girl crouched at his feet became to him, as he
gazed at her, something more than a mere amorous
acquaintance. She became a type, a symbol&mdash;an
incarnation of the formidable writing of that Moving
Finger, to which all flesh must bow. Her half-coquettish,
half-serious apprehensions, about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
ghostliness of the things that are always <em>listening</em>,
as the human drama works itself out in their dumb
presence, affected him in spite of himself. The village
of Hullaway seemed at that moment to have
disappeared into space, and he and his companion
to be isolated and suspended&mdash;remote from all terrestrial
activities, and yet aware of some confused
struggle between invisible antagonists.</p>

<p>From the splashing ducks in the pond who, every
now and then, so ridiculously turned up their squat
tails to the cloudy heavens, his eye wandered to the
impenetrable expectancy of the stone path which
bordered the muddy edge of the water. With the
quick sense of one whose daily occupation was concerned
with this particular stone, he began calculating
how long that time-worn pavement had remained
there, and how many generations of human feet,
hurrying or loitering, had passed along it since it
was first laid down. What actual men, he wondered,
had brought it there, from its resting-place,
æons-old in the distant hill, and laid it where it
now lay, slab by slab?</p>

<p>From where he sat he could just observe, between
a gap in the trees of the Manor-Farm garden, the
extreme edge of that Leonian promontory. It seemed
to him as though the hill were at that moment being
swept by a storm of rain. He shivered a little at
the idea of how such a sweeping storm, borne on a
northern wind, would invade those bare trenches
and unprotected escarpments. He felt glad that
his brother had selected Hullaway rather than that
particular spot for his angry retreat.</p>

<p>With a sense of relief he turned his eyes once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
to the girl reclining below him in such a charming
attitude.</p>

<p>How absurd it was, he thought, to let these
vague superstitions overmaster him! Surely it was
really an indication of cowardice, in the presence of
a hypothetical Fate, to make such fantastic vows
as that which he had recently made. It was all
part of the atavistic survival in him of that unhappy
“conscience,” which had done so much to
darken the history of the tribes of men. It was
like “touching wood” in honour of infernal deities!
What was the use of being a philosopher&mdash;of being
so deeply conscious of the illusive and subjective
nature of all these scruples&mdash;if, at a crisis, one only
fell back into such absurd morbidity? The vow he
had registered in his mind an hour before, seemed to
him now a piece of grotesque irrelevance&mdash;a lapse,
a concession to weakness, a reversion to primitive
inhibition. If it had been cowardice to make such
a vow, it were a still greater cowardice to keep it.</p>

<p>He rose from his seat on the stocks, and began idly
lifting up and down the heavy wooden bar which
surmounted this queer old pillory. He finally left
the thing open and gaping; its semi-circular cavities
ready for any offender. Moved by a sudden impulse,
the girl leant back still further against the
tree, and whimsically raising one of her little feet,
inserted it into the aperture. Amused at her companion’s
interest in this levity, and actuated by a
profound girlish instinct to ruffle the situation by
some startling caprice, she had no sooner got one
ankle into the cavity thus prepared for it, than
with a sudden effort she placed the other by its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
side, and coyly straightening her skirts with her
hands, looked up smiling into Luke’s face.</p>

<p>Thus challenged, as it were, by this wilful little
would-be malefactor, Luke was mechanically compelled
to complete her imprisonment. With a sudden
vicious snap he let down the enclosing bar.</p>

<p>She was now completely powerless; for the most
drastic laws of balance made it quite impossible that
she could release herself. It thus became inevitable
that he should slip down on the ground by her side,
and begin teasing her, indulging himself in sundry
innocent caresses which her helpless position made
it difficult to resist.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before Phyllis, fearful
of the appearance upon the scene of some of Hullaway’s
inhabitants, implored him to release her.</p>

<p>Luke rose and with his hand upon the bar contemplated
smilingly his fair prisoner.</p>

<p>“Please be quick!” the girl cried impatiently.
“I’m getting so stiff.”</p>

<p>“Shall I, or shan’t I?” said Luke provokingly.</p>

<p>The corner of the girl’s mouth fell and her under-lip
quivered. It only needed a moment’s further
delay to reduce her to tears.</p>

<p>At that moment two interruptions occurred simultaneously.
From the door of the King’s Arms
emerged the landlord, and began making vehement
signals to Luke; while from the corner of the road
to Nevilton appeared the figures of two young ladies,
walking briskly towards them, absorbed in earnest
conversation. These simultaneous events were observed
in varying ratio by the captive and her captor.
Luke was vaguely conscious of the two ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
and profoundly agitated by the appearance of the
landlord. Phyllis was vaguely conscious of the landlord
and was profoundly agitated by the appearance
of the ladies. The young stone-carver gave a quick
thoughtless jerk to the bar; and without waiting to
see the result, rushed off towards the inn. The
heavy block of wood, impelled by the impetus he
had given it, swung upwards, until it almost reached
the perpendicular. Then it descended with a crash.
The girl had just time to withdraw one of her ankles.
The other was imprisoned as hopeless as before.</p>

<p>Phyllis was overwhelmed with shame and embarrassment.
She had in a moment recognized Gladys,
and she felt as those Apocalyptic unfortunates in
Holy Scripture are reported as feeling when they
call upon the hills to cover them.</p>

<p>It had happened that Ralph Dangelis had been
compelled to pay a flying visit to London on business
connected with his proposed marriage. The two
cousins, preoccupied, each of them, with their separate
anxieties, had wandered thus far from home
to escape the teasing fussiness of Mrs. Romer, who
with her preparations for the double wedding gave
neither of them any peace.</p>

<p>They approached quite near to the group of elms
before either of them observed the unfortunate
Phyllis.</p>

<p>“Why!” cried Gladys suddenly to her companion.
“There’s somebody in the stocks!”</p>

<p>She went forward hastily, followed at a slower
pace by the Italian. Poor Phyllis, her bundle by
her side, and her cheeks tear-stained, presented a
woeful enough appearance. Her first inclination was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
to hide her face in her hands; but making a brave
effort, she turned her head towards the new-comers
with a gasping little laugh.</p>

<p>“I put my foot in here for a joke,” she stammered,
“and it got caught. Please let me out, Miss Romer.”</p>

<p>Gladys came quite near and laid her gloved hand
upon the wooden bar.</p>

<p>“It just lifts up, Miss,” pleaded Phyllis, with
tears in her voice. “It isn’t at all heavy.”</p>

<p>Gladys stared at her with a growing sense of interest.
The girl’s embarrassment under her scrutiny
awoke her Romer malice.</p>

<p>“I really don’t know that I want to let you out
in such a hurry,” she said. “If it’s a game you are
playing, it would be a pity to spoil it. Who put you
in? You must tell me that, before I set you free!
You couldn’t have done it yourself.”</p>

<p>By this time Lacrima had arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>The shame-faced Phyllis turned to her. “Please,
Miss Traffio, please, lift that thing up! It’s quite
easy to move.”</p>

<p>The Italian at once laid her hands upon the block
of wood and struggled to raise it; but Gladys had
no difficulty in keeping the bar immoveable.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” cried the younger girl
indignantly. “Take your arm away!”</p>

<p>“She must tell us first who put her where she is,”
reiterated Miss Romer. “I won’t have her let out
’till she tells us that!”</p>

<p>Phyllis looked piteously from one to the other.
Then she grew desperate.</p>

<p>“It was Luke Andersen,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Gladys. “Luke? Then he’s been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
out walking with you? Has he? Has he? Has
he?”</p>

<p>She repeated these words with such concentrated
fury that Phyllis began to cry. But the shock of this
information gave Lacrima her chance. Using all her
strength she lifted the heavy bar and released the
prisoner. Phyllis staggered to her feet and picked
up her bundle. Lacrima handed the girl her hat
and helped her to brush the dust from her clothes.</p>

<p>“So <em>you</em> are Luke’s latest fancy are you?”
Gladys said scowling fiercely at the glove-maker.</p>

<p>The pent-up feelings of the young woman broke
forth at once. Moving a step or two away from
them and glancing at a group of farm-men who were
crossing the green, she gave full scope to her revenge.</p>

<p>“I’m only Annie Bristow’s friend,” she retorted.
“Annie Bristow is going to marry Luke. They are
right down mad on one another.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” cried Gladys, completely forgetting
herself and looking as if she could have struck the
mocking villager.</p>

<p>“A lie, eh?” returned the other. “Tisn’t for me
to tell the tale to a young lady, the likes of you.
But we be all guessing down in Mr. North’s factory,
who ’twas that gave Luke the pretty lady-like ring
wot he lent to Annie!”</p>

<p>Gladys became livid with anger. “What ring?”
she cried. “Why are you talking about a ring?”</p>

<p>“Annie, she stuck it, for devilry, into that hole in
Splash-Lane stone. She pushed it in, tight as ’twere
a sham diamint. And there it do bide, the lady’s
pretty ring, all glittery and shiny, at bottom of that
there hole! We maids do go to see ’un glinsying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
and gleaming. It be the talk of the place, that ring
be! Scarce one of the childer but ’as ’ad its try to
hook ’un out. But ’tis no good. I guess Annie
must have rammed it down with her mother’s girt
skewer. ’Tis fast in that stone anyway, for all the
world to see. Folks, may-be, ’ll be coming from
Yeoborough, long as a few days be over, to see the
lady’s ring, wot Annie threw’d away, ’afore she said
‘yes’ to her young man!”</p>

<p>These final words were positively shouted by the
enraged Phyllis, as she tripped away, swinging her
bundle triumphantly.</p>

<p>It seemed for a moment as though Gladys meditated
a desperate pursuit, and the infliction of physical
violence upon her enemy. But Lacrima held
her fast by the hand. “For heaven’s sake, cousin,”
she whispered, “let her go. Look at those men
watching us!”</p>

<p>Gladys turned; but it was not at the farm-men
she looked.</p>

<p>Across the green towards them came the two
Andersens, Luke looking nervous and worried, and
his brother gesticulating strangely. The girls remained
motionless, neither advancing to meet them
nor making any attempt to evade them. Gladys
seemed to lose her defiant air, and waited their
approach, rather with the look of one expecting to
be chidden than of one prepared to chide. On all
recent occasions this had been her manner, when in
the presence of the young stone-carver.</p>

<p>The sight of Lacrima seemed to exercise a magical
effect upon James Andersen. He ceased at once his
excited talk, and advancing towards her, greeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
her in his normal tone&mdash;a tone of almost paternal
gentleness.</p>

<p>“It is nearly a quarter to one,” said Gladys,
addressing both the men. “Lacrima and I’ll have
all we can do to get back in time for lunch. Let’s
walk back together!”</p>

<p>Luke looked at his brother who gave him a friendly
smile. He also looked sharply at the Hullaway labourers,
who were shuffling off towards the barton of
the Manor-Farm.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” he said; “though it is a dangerous
time of day! But we can go by the fields, and
you can leave us at Roandyke Barn.”</p>

<p>They moved off along the edge of the pond together.</p>

<p>“It was Lacrima, not I, Luke,” said Gladys presently,
“who let that girl out.”</p>

<p>Luke flicked a clump of dock-weeds with his cane.
“It was her own fault,” he said carelessly. “I
thought I’d opened the thing. I was called away
suddenly.”</p>

<p>Gladys bowed her head submissively. In the
company of the young stone-carver her whole nature
seemed to change. A shrewd observer might even
have marked a subtle difference in her physical
appearance. She appeared to wilt and droop, like
a tropical flower transplanted into a northern
zone.</p>

<p>They remained all together until they reached the
fields. Then Gladys and Luke dropped behind.</p>

<p>“I have something I want to tell you,” said the
fair girl, as soon as the others were out of hearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
“Something very important.”</p>

<p>“I have something to tell you too,” answered
Luke, “and I think I will tell it first. It is hardly
likely that your piece of news can be as serious as
mine.”</p>

<p>They paused at a stile; and the girl made him take
her in his arms and kiss her, before she consented to
hear what he had to say.</p>

<p>It would have been noticeable to any observer that
in the caresses they exchanged, Luke played the perfunctory,
and she the passionate part. She kissed
him thirstily, insatiably, with clinging lips that
seemed avid of his very soul. When at last they
moved on through grass that was still wet with the
rain of the night before, Luke drew his hand away
from hers, as if to emphasize the seriousness of his
words.</p>

<p>“I am terribly anxious, dearest, about James,”
he said. “We had an absurd quarrel this morning,
and he rushed off to Hullaway in a rage. I found
him in the inn. He had been drinking, but it was
not that which upset him. He had not taken enough
to affect him in that way. I am very, very anxious
about him. I forget whether I’ve ever told you
about my mother? Her mind&mdash;poor darling&mdash;was
horribly upset before she died. She suffered from
more than one distressing mania. And my fear is
that James may go the same way.”</p>

<p>Gladys hung her head. In a strange and subtle
way she felt as though the responsibility of this new
catastrophe rested upon her. Her desperate passion
for Luke had so unnerved her, that she had become
liable to be victimized by any sort of superstitious
apprehension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>“How dreadful!” she whispered, “but he seemed to
me perfectly natural just now.”</p>

<p>“That was Lacrima’s doing,” said Luke. “Lacrima
is at the bottom of it all. I wish, oh, I wish,
she was going to marry James, instead of that uncle
of yours.”</p>

<p>“Father would never allow that,” said Gladys,
raising her head. “He is set upon making her take
uncle John. It has become a kind of passion with
him. Father is funny in these things.”</p>

<p>“Still&mdash;it might be managed,” muttered Luke
thoughtfully, “if we carried it through with a high
hand. We might arrange it; the world is malleable,
after all. If you and I, my dear, put our heads
together, Mr. John Goring might whistle for his
bride.”</p>

<p>“I <em>hate</em> Lacrima!” cried Gladys, with a sudden
access of her normal spirit.</p>

<p>“I don’t care two pence about Lacrima,” returned
Luke. “It is of James I am thinking.”</p>

<p>“But she would be happy with James, and I don’t
want her to be happy.”</p>

<p>“What a little devil you are!” exclaimed the stone-carver,
slipping his arm round her waist.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know I am,” she answered shamelessly.
“I suppose I inherit it from father. He hates people
just like that. But I am not a devil with you,
Luke, am I? I wish I were!” she added, after a little
pause.</p>

<p>“We must think over this business from every
point of view,” said Luke solemnly. “I cannot
help thinking that if you and I resolve to do it, we
can twist the fates round, somehow or another. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
am sure Lacrima could save James if she liked. If
you could only have seen the difference between
what he was when I was called back to him just now,
and what he became as soon as he set eyes upon
her, you would know what I mean. He is mad
about her, and if he doesn’t get her, he’ll go really
mad. He <em>was</em> a madman just now. He nearly
frightened that fool Titley into a fit.”</p>

<p>“I don’t <em>want</em> Lacrima to marry James,” burst
out Gladys. Luke in a moment drew his arm away,
and quickened his pace.</p>

<p>“As you please,” he said. “But I can promise
you this, my friend, that if anything does happen to
my brother, it’ll be the end of everything between
<em>us</em>.”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;what&mdash;how can you say such dreadful
things?” stammered the girl.</p>

<p>Luke airily swung his stick. “It all rests with
you, child. Though <em>we</em> can’t marry, there’s no
reason why we shouldn’t go on seeing each other,
as we do now, forever and ever,&mdash;as long as you
help me in this affair. But if you’re going to sulk
and talk this nonsense about ‘hating’&mdash;it is probable
that it will be a case of good-bye!”</p>

<p>The fair girl’s face was distorted by a spasmodic
convulsion of conflicting emotions. She bit her lip
and hung her head. Presently she looked up again
and flung her arms round his neck. “I’ll do anything
you ask me, Luke, anything, as long as you
don’t turn against me.”</p>

<p>They walked along for some time in silence, hand
in hand, taking care not to lose sight of their two
companions who seemed as engrossed as themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
in one another’s society. James Andersen was showing
sufficient discretion in avoiding the more frequented
foot-paths.</p>

<p>“Luke,” began the girl at last, “did you really
give my ring to Annie Santon?”</p>

<p>Luke’s brow clouded in a moment. “Damn
your ring!” he cried harshly. “I’ve got other things
to think about now than your confounded rings.
When people give me presents of that kind,” he added
“I take for granted I can do what I like with
them.”</p>

<p>Gladys trembled and looked pitifully into his face.</p>

<p>“But that girl said,” she murmured&mdash;“that factory
girl, I mean&mdash;that it had been lost in some way;
hidden, she said, in some hole in a stone. I can’t
believe that you would let me be made a laughing-stock
of, Luke dear?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry me about that,” replied the
stone-carver. “May-be it is so, may-be it isn’t so;
anyway it doesn’t matter a hang.”</p>

<p>“She said too,” pleaded Gladys in a hesitating
voice, “that you and Annie were going to be married.”</p>

<p>“Ho! ho!” laughed Luke, fumbling with some
tightly tied hurdles that barred their way; “so she
said that, did she? She <em>must</em> have had her knife
into you, our little Phyllis. Well, and what’s to
stop me if I did decide to marry Annie?”</p>

<p>Gladys gasped and looked at him with a drawn
and haggard face. Her beauty was of the kind that
required the flush of buoyant spirits to illuminate it.
The more her heart ached, the less attractive she
became. She was anything but beautiful now; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
as he looked at her, Luke noticed for the first time,
how low her hair grew upon her forehead.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t think of doing that?” she whispered,
in a tone of supplication. He laughed lightly
and lifting up her chin made as though he were
going to kiss her, but drew back without doing so.</p>

<p>“Are you going to be good,” he said, “and help
me to get Lacrima for James?”</p>

<p>She threw her arms round him. “I’ll do anything
you like&mdash;anything,” she repeated, “if you’ll only
let me love you!”</p>

<p>While this conversation was proceeding between
these two, a not less interesting clash of divergent
emotions was occurring between their friends. The
Italian may easily be pardoned if she never for one
second dreamed of the agitation in her companion’s
mind that had so frightened Luke. James’ manner
was in no way different from usual, and though he
expressed his feelings in a more unreserved fashion
than he had ever done before, Lacrima had been for
many weeks expecting some such outbreak.</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry with me,” he was saying, as he
strode by her side. “I had meant never to have
told you of this. I had meant to let it die with me,
without your ever knowing, but somehow&mdash;today&mdash;I
could not help it.”</p>

<p>He had confessed to her point blank, and in simple,
unbroken words, the secret of his heart, and Lacrima
had for some moments walked along with head
averted making no response.</p>

<p>It would not be true to say that this revelation
surprised her. It would be completely untrue to say
it offended her. It did not even enter her mind that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
it might have been kinder to have been less friendly,
less responsive, than she had been, to this queer
taciturn admirer. But circumstances had really
given her very little choice in the matter. She had
been, as it were, flung perforce upon his society, and
she had accepted, as a providential qualification of
her loneliness, the fact that he was attracted towards
her rather than repelled by her.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that had he remained untouched
by the evasive appeal of her timid grace; had he,
for instance, remained a provocative and impenetrable
mystery at her side, she might have been led
to share his feelings. But, unluckily for poor Andersen,
the very fact that his feelings had been disclosed
only too clearly, militated hopelessly against
such an event. He was no remote, shadowy, romantic
possibility to her&mdash;a closed casket of wonders,
difficult and dangerous to open. He was simply a
passionate and assiduous lover. The fact that he
<em>could</em> love her, lowered him a little in Lacrima’s
esteem. True to her Pariah instincts she felt that
such passion was a sign of weakness in him; and if she
did not actually despise him for it, it materially lessened
the interest she took in the workings of his mind.
Maurice Quincunx drew her to him for the very reason
that he was so sexless, so cold, so wayward, so full of
whimsical caprices. Maurice, a Pariah himself, excited
at the same time her maternal tenderness and her
imaginative affection. If she did not feel the passion
for him that she might have felt for Andersen, had
Andersen remained inaccessible; that was only because
there was something in Maurice’s peculiar egoism
which chilled such feelings at their root.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>Another almost equally effective cause of her lack
of response to the stone-carver’s emotion was the
cynical and world-deep weariness that had fallen upon
her, since this dreadful marriage with Goring had become
a settled event. Face to face with this, she
felt as though nothing mattered very much, and as
though any feeling she herself might excite in another
person must needs be like the passing of a shadow
across a mirror&mdash;something vague, unreal, insubstantial&mdash;something
removed to a remote distance,
like the voice of a person at the end of a long
tunnel, or as the dream of someone who is himself a
figure in a dream. If anyone, she felt, broke into
the enchanted circle that surrounded her, it was as if
they sought to make overtures to a person dead and
buried.</p>

<p>It was almost with the coldness and detachment of
the dead that she now answered him, and her voice
went sighing across the wet fields with a desolation
that would have struck a more normal mind than
Andersen’s as the incarnation of tragedy. He was
himself, however, strung up to such a tragic note,
that the despair in her tone affected him less than it
would have affected another.</p>

<p>“I have come to feel,” said she, “that I have no
heart, and I feel as though this country of yours
had no heart. It ought to be always cloudy and dark
in this place. Sunshine here is a kind of bitter
mockery.”</p>

<p>“You do not know&mdash;you do not know what you
say,” cried the poor stone-carver, quickening his
pace in his excitement so that it became difficult for
her to keep up with him. “I have loved you, since I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
first saw you&mdash;that day&mdash;down at our works&mdash;when
the hawthorn was out. <em>My</em> heart at any rate is
deep enough, deep enough to be hurt more than you
would believe, Lacrima. Oh, if things were only
different! If you could only bring yourself to care
for me a little&mdash;just a little! Lacrima, listen to me.”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly in the middle of a field and made
her turn and face him. He laid his hand solemnly
and imploringly upon her wrist. “Why need you
put yourself under this frightful yoke? I know
something of what you have had to go through. I
know something, though it may be only a little, of
what this horrible marriage means to you. Lacrima,
for your own sake&mdash;as well as mine&mdash;for the sake of
everyone who has ever cared for you&mdash;don’t let them
drag you into this atrocious trap.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>
<p>“Trust me, give yourself boldly into my care.
Let’s go away together and try our fortune in some
new place! All places are not like Nevilton. I am a
strong man, I know my trade, I could earn money
easily to keep us both. Lacrima, don’t turn away,
don’t look so helpless! After all, things might be
worse, you might be already married to that man,
and be buried alive forever! It is not yet too late.
You are still free. I beg and implore you, by everything
you hold sacred, to stop and escape before it is
too late. It doesn’t matter that you don’t love me
now. As long as you don’t utterly hate me all can
be put right. I don’t ask you to return what I feel
for you. I won’t ask it if you agree to marry me.
I’ll make any contract with you you please, and
swear any vow. I won’t come near you when we are
together. We can live under one roof as brother
and sister. The wedding-ring will be nothing between
us. It will only protect you from the rest of
the world. I won’t interfere with your life at all,
when once I have freed you from this devil’s hole.
It will only be a marriage in form, in name; everything
else will be just as you please. I will obey
your least wish, your least fancy. If you want to
go back to your own country and to go alone, I will
save up money enough to make that possible. In
fact, I have now got money enough to pay your
journey and I would send out more to you. Lacrima,
let me help you to break away from all this. You
must, Lacrima, you must and you shall! If you
prefer it, we needn’t ever be married. I don’t want
to take advantage of you. I’ll give you every
penny I have and help you out of the country and
then send you more as I earn it. It is madness,
this devilish marriage they are driving you into. It
is madness and folly to submit to it. It is monstrous.
It is ridiculous. You are free to go, they have no
hold upon you. Lacrima, Lacrima! why are you so
cruel to yourself, to me, to everyone who cares for
you?”</p>

<p>He drew breath at last, but continued to clutch
her wrist with a trembling hand, glancing anxiously,
as he waited, at the lessening distance that separated
them from the others.</p>

<p>Lacrima looked at him with a pale troubled face,
but her large eyes were full of tears and when she
spoke her voice quivered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>
<p>“I was wrong, my friend, to say that none of you
here had any heart. Your heart is large and noble.
I shall never&mdash;never forget what you have now said
to me. But James&mdash;but James, dear,” and her voice
shook still more, “I cannot, I cannot do it. There
are more reasons than I can explain to you, why
this thing must happen. It <em>has</em> to happen, and we
must bow our heads and submit. After all, life is
not very long, or very happy, at the best. Probably,”&mdash;and
she smiled a sad little smile,&mdash;“I should disappoint
you frightfully if we did go together. I am
not such a nice person as you suppose. I have queer
moods&mdash;oh, such strange, strange moods!&mdash;and I know
for certain that I should not make you happy.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you a horrible secret, James?” Here
her voice sank into a curious whisper and she laughed
a low distressing laugh. “I have really got the soul,
the <em>soul</em> I say, not the nerves or sense, of a girl who
has lost everything,&mdash;I wish I could make you understand&mdash;who
has lost self-respect and everything,&mdash;I
have thought myself into this state. I don’t care
now&mdash;I really don’t&mdash;<em>what</em> happens to me. James,
dear&mdash;you wouldn’t want to marry a person like that,
a person who feels herself already dead and buried?
Yes, and worse than dead! A person who has lost
all pity, all feeling, even for herself. A person who
is past even caring for the difference between right
and wrong! You wouldn’t want to be kind to a
person like that, James, would you?”</p>

<p>She stopped and gazed into his face, smiling a woeful
little smile. Andersen mechanically noticed that
their companions had observed their long pause, and
had delayed to advance, resting beneath the shelter
of a wind-tossed ash-tree. The stone-carver began
to realize the extraordinary and terrible loneliness
of every human soul. Here he was, face to face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
with the one being of all beings whose least look or
word thrilled him with intolerable excitement, and
yet he could not as much as touch the outer margin
of her real consciousness.</p>

<p>He had not the least idea, even at that fatal moment,
what her inner spirit was feeling; what thoughts,
what sensations, were passing through her soul. Nor
could he ever have. They might stand together thus,
isolated from all the world, through an eternity of
physical contact, and he would never attain such
knowledge. She would always remain aloof, mysterious,
evasive. He resolved that at all events as
far as he himself was concerned, there should be no
barrier between them. He would lay open to her
the deepest recesses of his heart.</p>

<p>He began a hurried incoherent history of his passion,
of its growth, its subtleties, its intensity. He
tried to make her realize what she had become for
him, how she filled every hour of every day with her
image. He explained to her how clearly and fully
he understood the difficulty, the impossibility, of his
ever bringing her to care for him as he cared for
her.</p>

<p>He even went so far as to allude to Mr. Quincunx,
and implored her to believe that he would be well
content if she would let him earn money enough to
support both her and Maurice, either in Nevilton or
elsewhere, if it would cut the tragic knot of her fate
to join her destiny to that of the forlorn recluse.</p>

<p>It almost seemed as though this final stroke of
self-abnegation excited more eloquence in him than
all the rest. He begged and conjured her to cut
boldly loose from the Romer bonds, and marry her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
queer friend, if he, rather than any other, were the
choice she made. His language became so vehement,
his tone so impassioned and exalted, that the
girl began to look apprehensively at him. Even
this apprehension, however, was a thing strangely
removed from reality. His reckless words rose and
fell upon the air and mixed with the rising wind as
if they were words remembered from some previous
existence. The man’s whole figure, his gaunt frame,
his stooping shoulders, his long arms and lean fingers,
seemed to her like something only half-tangible,
something felt and seen through a dim medium of
obscuring mist.</p>

<p>Lacrima felt vaguely as though all this were happening
to someone else, to someone she had read
about in a book, or had known in remote childhood.
The overhanging clouds, the damp grass, the distant
ash-tree with the forms of their friends beneath
it, all these things seemed to group themselves in
her mind, as if answering to some strange dramatic
story, which was not the story of her life at all, but
of some other harassed and troubled spirit.</p>

<p>In the depths of her mind she shrank away
half-frightened and half-indifferent from this man’s
impassioned pleading and heroic proposals. The humorously
cynical image of the hermit of Dead Man’s
Lane crossed her mental vision as a sort of wavering
Pharos light in the dreamy twilight of her consciousness.
How well she knew with what goblin-like
quiver of his nostrils, with what sardonic gleam of
his eyes, he would have listened to his rival’s exalted
rhetoric.</p>

<p>In some strange way she felt almost angry with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
this bolder, less cautious lover, for being what her
poor nervous Maurice never could be. She caught
herself shuddering at the thought of the drastic
effort, the stern focussing of will-power which the
acceptance of any one of his daring suggestions would
imply. Perhaps, who can say, there had come to
be a sort of voluptuous pleasure in thus lying back
upon her destiny and letting herself be carried forward,
at the caprice of other wills than her own.</p>

<p>Mingled with these other complex reactions, there
was borne in upon her, as she listened to him, a
queer sense of the absolute unimportance of the
whole matter. The long strain upon her nerves, of
her sojourn in Nevilton House, had left her physically
so weary that she lacked the life-energy to supply
the life-illusion. The ardour and passion of
Andersen’s suggestions seemed, for all their dramatic
pathos, to belong to a world she had left&mdash;a world
from which she had risen or sunk so completely, that
all return was impossible. Her nature was so hopelessly
the true Pariah-nature, that the idea of the
effort implied in any struggle to escape her doom,
seemed worse than the doom itself.</p>

<p>This inhibition of any movement of effective resistance
in the Pariah-type is the thing that normal
temperaments find most difficult of all to understand.
It would seem almost incredible to a healthy
minded person that Lacrima should deliberately let
herself be driven into such a fate without some last
desperate struggle. Those who find it so, however,
under-estimate that curious passion of submission
from which these victims of circumstance suffer, a
passion of submission which is itself, in a profoundly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
subtle way, a sort of narcotic or drug to the wretchedness
they pass through.</p>

<p>“I cannot do it,” she repeated in a low tired voice,
“though I think it’s generous, beyond description,
what you want to do for me. But I cannot do it.
It’s difficult somehow to tell you why, James dear;
there are certain things that are hard to say, even
to people that we love as much as I love you. For
I do love you, in spite of everything. I hope you
realize that. And I know that you have a deep
noble heart.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with wistful and appealing
tenderness, and let her little fingers slip into his
feverish hand.</p>

<p>When she said the words, “I do love you,” a shivering
ecstasy shot through the stone-carver’s veins,
followed by a ghastly chilliness, like the hand of
death, as he grasped their complete meaning. The
most devastating tone, perhaps, of all, for an impassioned
lover to hear, is that particular tone of
calm tender affection. It has the power of closing
up vistas of hope more effectively than the expression
of the most vigorous repulsion. There was a
ring of weary finality in her voice that echoed through
his mind, like the tread of coffin-bearers through a
darkened passage. Things had reached their hopeless
point, and the two were standing mute and
silent, in the attitude of persons taking a final farewell
of one another, when a noisy group of village
maids, on their dilatory road to the glove-factory,
made their voices audible from the further side of
the nearest hedge.</p>

<p>They both turned instantaneously to see how this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
danger of discovery affected their friends, and neither
of them was surprised to note that the younger
Andersen had left his companion and was strolling
casually in the direction of the voices. As soon as
he saw that they had observed this manœuvre he
began beckoning to James.</p>

<p>“We’d better separate, my friend,” whispered
Lacrima hastily. “I’ll go back to Gladys. She and
I must take the lane way and you and Luke the
path by the barn. We’ll meet again before&mdash;before
anything happens.”</p>

<p>They separated accordingly and as the two girls
passed through the gate that led into the Nevilton
road, they could distinctly hear, across the fields,
the ringing laughter of the high-spirited glove-makers
as they chaffed and rallied the two stone-carvers
through the thick bramble hedge which intervened
between them.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">SAGITTARIUS</span></h2>

<p>The summer of the year whose events, in so far
as they affected a certain little group of Nevilton
people we are attempting to describe,
seemed, to all concerned, to pass more and more
rapidly, as the days began again to shorten. July
gave place to August, and Mr. Goring’s men were
already at work upon the wheat-harvest. In the
hedges appeared all those peculiar signals of the
culmination of the season’s glory, which are, by one
of nature’s most emphatic ironies, the signals also of
its imminent decline.</p>

<p>Old-man’s-beard, for instance, hung its feathery
clusters on every bush; and, in shadier places, white
and black briony twined their decorative leaves and
delicate flowers. The blossom of the blackberry
bushes was already giving place to unripe fruit, and
the berries of traveller’s-joy were beginning to turn
red. Hips and haws still remained in that vague
colourless state which renders them indistinguishable
to all eyes save those of the birds, but the juicy
clusters of the common night-shade&mdash;“green grapes
of Proserpine”&mdash;greeted the wanderer with their
poisonous Circe-like attraction, from their thrones of
dog-wood and maple, and whispered of the autumn’s
approach. In dry deserted places the scarlet splendour
of poppies was rapidly yielding ground to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
those queer herbal plants, purplish or whitish in hue&mdash;the
wild hyssop, or marjoram, being the most noticeable
of them&mdash;which more than anything else denote
the coming on of the equinox. From dusty heaps of
rubbish the aromatic daisy-like camomile gave forth
its pungent fragrance, and in damper spots the tall
purple heads of hemp-agrimony flouted the dying
valerian.</p>

<p>An appropriate date at the end of the month had
been fixed for the episcopal visit to Nevilton; and
the candidates for confirmation were already beginning,
according to their various natures and temperaments,
to experience that excited anticipation, which,
even in the dullest intelligence, such an event arouses.</p>

<p>The interesting ceremony of Gladys Romer’s baptism
had been fixed for a week earlier than this,
a fanciful sentiment in the agitated mind of Mr.
Clavering having led to the selection of this particular
day on the strange ground of its exact coincidence
with the anniversary of a certain famous saint.</p>

<p>The marriage of Gladys with Dangelis, and of
Lacrima with John Goring, was to take place early
in September, Mrs. Romer having stipulated for
reasons of domestic economy that the two events
should be simultaneous.</p>

<p>Another project of some importance to at least
three persons in Nevilton, was now, as one might
say, in the air; though this was by no means a
matter of public knowledge. I refer to Vennie Seldom’s
fixed resolution to be received into the Catholic
Church and to become a nun.</p>

<p>Ever since her encounter in the village street with
the loquacious Mr. Wone, Vennie had been oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
by an invincible distaste for the things and people
that surrounded her. Her longing to give the world
the slip and devote herself completely to the religious
life had been incalculably deepened by her
disgust at what she considered the blasphemous introduction
of the Holy Name into the Christian Candidate’s
political canvassing. The arguments of Mr.
Taxater and the conventional anglicanism of her
mother, were, compared with this, only mild incentives
to the step she meditated. The whole fabric
of her piety and her taste had been shocked to their
foundations by the unctuous complacency of Mr.
Romer’s evangelical rival.</p>

<p>Vennie felt, as she stood aside, in her retired routine,
and watched the political struggle sway to and
fro in the village, as though the champions of both
causes were odiously and repulsively in the wrong.
The sly conservatism of the quarry-owner becoming,
since the settlement of the strike, almost fulsome
in its flattery of the working classes, struck her as
the most unscrupulous bid for power that she had
ever encountered; and when, combined with his new
pose as the ideal employer and landlord, Mr. Romer
introduced the imperial note, and talked lavishly of
the economic benefits of the Empire, Vennie felt
as though all that was beautiful and sacred in her
feeling for the country of her birth, was blighted and
poisoned at the root.</p>

<p>But Mr. Wone’s attitude of mind struck her as
even more revolting. The quarry-owner was at
least frankly and flagrantly cynical. He made no
attempt&mdash;unless Gladys’ confirmation was to be regarded
as such&mdash;to conciliate religious sentiment. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
never went to church, and in private conversation he
expressed his atheistic opinions with humorous and
careless shamelessness. But Mr. Wone’s intermingling
of Protestant unction with political chicanery
struck the passionate soul of the young girl as something
very nearly approaching the “unpardonable
sin.” Her incisive intelligence, fortified of late by
conversations with Mr. Taxater, revolted, too, against
the vague ethical verbiage and loose democratic
sentiment with which Mr. Wone garnished his lightest
talk. Since Philip’s release from prison and his reappearance
in the village, she had taken the opportunity
of having several interviews with the Christian
Candidate’s son, and these interviews, though they
saddened and perplexed her, increased her respect
for the young man in proportion as they diminished
it for his father. With true feminine instinct Vennie
found the anarchist more attractive than the socialist,
and the atheist less repugnant than the
missionary.</p>

<p>One afternoon, towards the end of the first week
in August, Vennie persuaded Mr. Taxater to accompany
her on a long walk. They made their way
through the wood which separates the fields around
Nevilton Mount from the fields around Leo’s Hill.
Issuing from this wood, along the path followed by
every visitor to the hill who wishes to avoid its
steeper slopes, they strolled leisurely between the
patches of high bracken-fern and looked down upon
the little church of Athelston.</p>

<p>Athelston was a long, rambling village, encircling
the northern end of the Leonian promontory and
offering shelter, in many small cottages all heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
built of the same material, to those of the workmen
in the quarries who were not domiciled in Nevilton.</p>

<p>“It would be rather nice,” said Vennie to the
theologian, “if it wouldn’t spoil our walk, to go
and look at that carving in the porch, down there.
They say it has been cleaned lately, and the figures
show up more clearly.”</p>

<p>The papal champion gravely surveyed the outline
of the little cruciform church, as it shimmered, warm
and mellow, in the misty sunshine at their feet.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” he remarked. “I met our friend
Andersen there the other day. He told me he had
been doing the work quite alone. He said it was one
of the most interesting things he had ever done.
By the way, I am confident that that rumour we
heard, of his getting unsettled in his mind, is absolutely
untrue. I have never found him more sensible&mdash;you
know how silent he is as a rule? When I
met him he was quite eloquent on the subject of
mediæval carving.”</p>

<p>Vennie looked down and smiled&mdash;a sad little smile.
“I’m afraid,” she said; “that his talking so freely
is not quite a good sign. But do let’s go. I have
never looked at those queer figures with anyone but
my mother; and you know the way she has of
making everything seem as if it were an ornament
on her own mantelpiece.”</p>

<p>They began descending the hill, Mr. Taxater displaying
more agility than might have been expected
of him, as they scrambled down between furze-bushes,
rabbit-holes, and beds of yellow trefoil.</p>

<p>“How dreadfully I shall miss you, dear child,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
said. “No one could accuse me of selfishness in furthering
your wish for the religious life. Half the pleasant
discoveries I’ve made in this charming country
have been due to you.”</p>

<p>The young girl turned and regarded him affectionately.
“You have been more than a father to
me,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Ah, Vennie, Vennie!” he protested, “you mustn’t
talk like that. After all, the greatest discovery we
have made, is the discovery of your calling for
religion. I have much to be thankful for. It is
not often that I have been permitted such a privilege.
If we had not been thrown together, who knows but
that the influence of our good Clavering&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Vennie blushed scarlet at the mention of the priest’s
name, and to hide her confusion, buried her head
in a great clump of rag-wort, pressing its yellow
clusters vehemently against her cheeks, with agitated
trembling hands.</p>

<p>When she lifted up her face, the fair hair under her
hat was sprinkled with dewy moisture. “The turn
of the year has come,” she said. “There’s mist on
everything today.” She smiled, with a quick embarrassed
glance at her companion.</p>

<p>“The turn of the year has come,” repeated the
champion of the papacy.</p>

<p>They descended the slope of yet another field, and
then paused again, leaning upon a gate.</p>

<p>“Have you ever thought how strange it is,” remarked
the girl, as they turned to survey the scene
around them, “that those two hills should still, in
a way, represent the struggle between good and
evil? I always wish that my ancestors had built a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
chapel on Nevilton Mount instead of that silly little
tower.”</p>

<p>The theologian fixed his eyes on the two eminences
which, from the point where they stood,
showed so emphatically against the smouldering
August sky.</p>

<p>“Why do you call Leo’s Hill evil?” he asked.</p>

<p>Vennie frowned. “I always have felt like that
about it,” she answered. “It’s an odd fancy I’ve got.
I can’t quite explain it. Perhaps it’s because I know
something of the hard life of the quarry-men. Perhaps
it’s because of Mr. Romer. I really can’t tell
you. But that’s the feeling I have!”</p>

<p>“Our worthy Mr. Wone would thank you, if you
lent him your idea for use in his speeches,” remarked
the theologian with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“That’s just it!” cried Vennie. “It teases me,
more than I can say, that the cause of the poor
should be in his hands. I can’t associate <em>him</em> with
anything good or sacred. His being the one to
oppose Mr. Romer makes me feel as though God had
left us completely, left us at the mercy of the false
prophets!”</p>

<p>“Child, child!” expostulated Mr. Taxater&mdash;“<i>Custodit
Dominus animas sanctorum suorum; de manu
peccatoris liberabit eos</i>.”</p>

<p>“But it is so strange,” continued Vennie. “It is
one of the things I cannot understand. Why should
God have to use other means than those His church
offers to defeat the designs of wicked people? I wish
miracles happened more often! Sometimes I dream
of them happening. I dreamt the other night that
an angel, with a great silver sword, stood on the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
of Nevilton Mount, and cried aloud to all the dead
in the churchyard. Why can’t God send real angels
to fight His battles, instead of using wolves in
sheep’s clothing like that wretched Mr. Wone?”</p>

<p>The champion of the papacy smiled. “You are
too hard on our poor Candidate, Vennie. There’s
more of the sheep than the wolf about our worthy
Wone, after all. But you touch upon a large question,
my dear; a large question. That great circle,
whose centre is everywhere and its circumference
nowhere, as St. Thomas says, must needs include
many ways to the fulfilment of His ends, which are
mysterious to us. God is sometimes pleased to use
the machinations of the most evil men, even their
sensual passions, and their abominable vices, to
bring about the fulfilment of His will. And we, dear
child,” he added after a pause, “must follow God’s
methods. That is why the church has always condemned
as a dangerous heresy that Tolstoyan doctrine
of submission to evil. We must never submit
to evil! Our duty is to use against it every weapon
the world offers. Weapons that in themselves are
unholy, become holy&mdash;nay! even sacred&mdash;when
used in the cause of God and His church.”</p>

<p>Vennie remained puzzled and silent. She felt a
vague, remote dissatisfaction with her friend’s argument;
but she found it difficult to answer. She
glanced sadly up at the cone-shaped mount above
them, and wished that in place of that heathen-looking
tower, she could see her angel with the
silver sword.</p>

<p>“It is all very confusing,” she murmured at last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
“and I shall be glad when I am out of it.”</p>

<p>The theologian laid his hand&mdash;the hand that
ought to have belonged to a prince of the church&mdash;upon
his companion’s.</p>

<p>“You will be out of it soon, child,” he said, “and
then you will help us by your prayers. We who are
the temporal monks of the great struggle are bound
to soil our hands in the dust of the arena. But
your prayers, and the prayers of many like you,
cleanse them continually from such unhappy stains.”</p>

<p>Even at the moment he was uttering these profound
words, Mr. Taxater was wondering in his heart
how far his friend’s inclination to a convent depended
upon an impulse much more natural and feminine
than the desire to avoid the Mr. Romers and Mr.
Wones of this poor world. He made a second rather
brutal experiment.</p>

<p>“We must renounce,” he said, “all these plausible
poetic attempts to be wiser than God’s Holy Church.
That is one of the faults into which our worthy
Clavering falls.”</p>

<p>Once more the tell-tale scarlet rushed into the
cheeks of Nevilton’s little nun.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, stooping to pluck a spray of
wild basil, “I know.”</p>

<p>They opened the gate, and very soon found themselves
at the entrance to Athelston church. Late
summer flowers, planted in rows on each side of
the path, met them with a ravishing fragrance.
Stocks and sweet-williams grew freely among the
graves; and tall standard roses held up the wealth
of their second blossoming, like chalices full of
red and white wine. Heavy-winged brown butterflies
fluttered over the grass, like the earth-drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
spirits, Vennie thought, of such among the dead as
were loath to leave the scene of their earthly pleasures.
Mounted upon a step-ladder in the porch was
the figure of James Andersen, absorbed in removing
the moss and lichen from the carving in the central
arch.</p>

<p>He came down at once when he perceived their
approach. “Look!” he said, with a wave of his hand,
“you can see what it is now.”</p>

<p>Obedient to his words they both gazed curiously
at the quaint early Norman relief. It represented
a centaur, with a drawn bow and arrow, aiming at
a retreating lion, which was sneaking off in humorously
depicted terror.</p>

<p>“That is King Stephen,” said the stone-carver,
pointing to the centaur. “And the beast he is
aiming at is Queen Maud. Stephen’s zodiacal sign
was Sagittarius, and the woman’s was Leo. Hence
the arrow he is aiming.”</p>

<p>Vennie’s mind, reverting to her fanciful distinction
between the two eminences, and woman-like, associating
everything she saw with the persons of her
own drama, at once began to discern, between the
retreating animal and the fair-haired daughter of the
owner of Leo’s Hill, a queer and grotesque resemblance.</p>

<p>She heaved a deep sigh. What would she not give
to see her poor priest-centaur aim such an arrow of
triumph at the heart of his insidious temptress!</p>

<p>“I think you have made them stand out wonderfully
clear,” she said gently. “Hasn’t he, Mr.
Taxater?”</p>

<p>The stone-carver threw down the instrument he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
was using, and folded his arms. His dark, foreign-looking
countenance wore a very curious expression.</p>

<p>“I wanted to finish this job,” he remarked, in a
slow deep voice, “before I turn into stone myself.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, my friend,” said Mr. Taxater, while
Vennie stared in speechless alarm at the carver’s
face. “You mustn’t talk like that! You people
get a wrong perspective in things. Remember, this
is no longer the Stone Age. The power of stone was
broken once for all, when certain women of Palestine
found that stone, which we’ve all heard of, lifted
out of its place! Since then it is to wood&mdash;the
wood out of which His cross was made&mdash;not to
stone, that we must look.”</p>

<p>The carver raised his long arm and pointed in the
direction of Leo’s Hill. “Twenty years,” he said,
“have I been working on this stone. I used to despise
such work. Then I grew to care for it. Then
there came a change. I loved the work! It was the
only thing I loved. I loved to feel the stone under
my hands, and to watch it yielding to my tools. I
think the soul of it must have passed into my soul.
It seemed to know me; to respond to me. We became
like lovers, the stone and I!” He laughed an
uneasy, disconcerting laugh; and went on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>
<p>“But that is not all. Another change came. <em>She</em>
came into my life. I needn’t tell you, Miss Seldom,
who I mean. You know well enough. These things
cannot be hidden. Nothing can be hidden that
happens here! She came and was kind to me.
She is kind to me still. But they have got hold of
her. She can’t resist them. Why she can’t, I cannot
say; but it seems impossible. She talks to me like
a person in a dream. They’re going to marry her
to that brute Goring. You’ve heard that I suppose?
But of course it’s nothing to you! Why should it be?”</p>

<p>He paused, and Vennie interrupted him sharply.
“It is a great deal to us, Mr. Andersen! Every
cruel thing that is done in a place affects everyone
who lives in the place. If Mr. Taxater and&mdash;and
Mr. Clavering&mdash;thought that Miss Traffio was
being driven into this marriage, I’m sure they would
not allow it! They would do something&mdash;everything&mdash;to
stop such an outrage. Wouldn’t you, Mr.
Taxater?”</p>

<p>“But surely, Vennie,” said the theologian, “you
have heard something of this? You can’t be quite
so oblivious, as all that, to the village scandal?”</p>

<p>He spoke with a certain annoyance as people are
apt to do, when some disagreeable abuse, which they
have sought to forget, is brought vividly before them.</p>

<p>Vennie, too, became irritable. The question of
Lacrima’s marriage had more than once given her
conscience a sharp stab. “I think it is a shame to
us all,” she cried vehemently, “that this should be
allowed. It is only lately that I’ve heard rumours
of it, and I took them for mere gossip. It’s been on
my mind.” She looked almost sternly at the theologian.
“I meant to talk to you about it. But
other things came between. I haven’t seen Lacrima
for several weeks. Surely, if it is as Mr. Andersen
says, something ought to be done! It is a horrible,
perfectly horrible idea!” She covered her face with
her hands as if to shut out some unbearable vision.</p>

<p>James Andersen watched them both intently, leaning
against the wood-work of the church-door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought you all knew of this,” he said presently.
“Perhaps you did; but the devil prompted you to
say nothing. There are a great many things in this
world which are done while people&mdash;good people&mdash;look
on&mdash;and nothing said. Do you wonder now
that the end of this business will be a curious one;
I mean for me? For you know, of course, what
is going to happen? You know why I have been
chosen to work at this particular piece of carving?
And why, ever since I quarrelled with Luke and
drank in Hullaway Inn, I have heard voices in my
head? The reason of that is, that Leo’s Hill is angry
because I have deserted it. Every stone I touch is
angry, and keeps talking to me and upbraiding me.
The voices I hear are the voices of all the stones I
have ever worked with in my life. But they needn’t
fret themselves. The end will surprise even them.
<em>They</em> do not know,”&mdash;here his voice took a lower
tone, and he assumed that ghastly air of imparting
a piece of surprising, but quite natural, information,
which is one of the most sinister tokens of monomania,&mdash;“that
I shall very soon be, even as they are!
Isn’t it funny they don’t know that, Miss Seldom?
Isn’t it a curious thing, Mr. Taxater? I thought of
that, just now, as I chipped the dirt from King
Stephen. Even <em>he</em> didn’t know, the foolish centaur!
And yet he has been up there, seeing this sort of
thing done, for seven hundred years! I expect he
has seen so many girls dragged under this arch, with
sick terror in their hearts, that he has grown callous
to it. A callous king! A knavish-smiling king! It
makes me laugh to think how little he cares!”</p>

<p>The unfortunate man did indeed proceed to laugh;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
but the sound of it was so ghastly, even to himself,
that he quickly became grave.</p>

<p>“Luke will be here soon,” he said. “Luke has
always come for me, these last few days, when his
work is over. It’ll be over soon now, I think. He
may be here any moment; so I’d better finish the
job. Don’t you worry about Lacrima, ladies and
gentlemen! She’ll fly away with the rooks. This
centaur-king will never reach <em>her</em> with his arrows.
It’ll be me, not her, he’ll turn into stone!”</p>

<p>He became silent and continued his labour upon the
carving. The wonder was that with his head full of
such mad fancies he could manage so delicate a
piece of work. Mr. Taxater and Vennie watched
him in amazement.</p>

<p>“I think,” whispered the latter presently, “we’d
better wait in the churchyard till his brother comes.
I don’t like leaving him in this state.”</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater nodded, and retreating to the further
end of the path, they sat down together upon a
flat tombstone.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said Mr. Taxater, after a minute
or two’s silence, “that I spoke rather crossly to you
just now. The truth is, the man’s reference to that
Italian girl made me feel ashamed of myself. I have
not your excuse of being ignorant of what was going
on. I have, in fact, been meaning to talk to you
about it for some weeks; but I hesitated, wishing to
be quite sure of my ground first.</p>

<p>“Even now, you must remember, we have no certain
authority to go upon. But I’m afraid&mdash;I’m
very much afraid&mdash;what Andersen says is true.
It is evidently his own certain knowledge of it that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
has upset his brain. And I’m inclined to take his
word for it. I fear the girl must have told him herself;
and it was the shock of hearing it from her
that had this effect.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt he’s seriously ill. But if I know
anything of these things, it’s rather a case of extreme
nervous agitation than actual insanity. In any
event, it’s a relief to remember that this kind of
mania is, of all forms of brain-trouble, the easiest
cured.”</p>

<p>Vennie made an imperious little gesture. “We
<em>must</em> cure him!” she cried. “We must! We must!
And the only way to do it, as far as I can see, is to
stop this abominable marriage. Lacrima can’t be
doing it willingly. No girl would marry a man like
that, of her own accord.”</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater shook his head. “I’m afraid there
are few people,” he remarked, “that some girl or
other wouldn’t marry if the motive were strong
enough! The question is, What is the motive in this
instance?”</p>

<p>“What can Mr. Quincunx be thinking of?” said
Vennie. “He hasn’t been up to see mother lately.
In fact, I don’t think he has been in our house since
he began working in Yeoborough. That’s another
abominable shame! It seems to me more and more
clear that there’s an evil destiny hanging over this
place, driving people on to do wicked things!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we shall get small assistance from
Mr. Quincunx,” said the theologian. “The relations
between him and Lacrima are altogether beyond my
power of unravelling. But I cannot imagine his
taking any sort of initiative in any kind of difficulty.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then what are we to do?” pleaded Vennie, looking
anxiously into the diplomatist’s face.</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater rested his chin upon the handle of his
cane and made no reply.</p>

<p>At this moment the gate clicked behind them, and
Luke Andersen appeared. He glanced hastily towards
the porch; but his brother was absorbed in
his work and apparently had heard nothing. Stepping
softly along the edge of the path he approached
the two friends. He looked very anxious and
troubled.</p>

<p>Raising his hat to Vennie, he made a gesture with
his hand in his brother’s direction. “Have you seen
him?” he enquired. “Has he talked to you?”</p>

<p>The theologian nodded.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think all this is dreadful!” whispered Vennie.
“I’m more distressed than I can tell you. I’m
afraid he’s very, very ill. And he keeps talking
about Miss Traffio. Surely something can be done,
Mr. Andersen, to stop that marriage before it’s too
late?”</p>

<p>Luke turned upon her with an expression completely
different from any she had ever seen him wear before.
He seemed to have suddenly grown much older.
His mouth was drawn, and a little open; and his
cheeks were pale and indented by deep lines.</p>

<p>“I would give my soul,” he said with intense emphasis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
“to have this thing otherwise. I have already
been to Lacrima&mdash;to Miss Traffio, I mean&mdash;but
she will do nothing. She is mad, too, I think.
I hoped to get her to marry my brother, off-hand,
anyhow; and leave the place with him. But she
won’t hear of it. I can’t understand her! It almost
seems as if she <em>wanted</em> to marry that clown. But
she can’t really; it’s impossible. I’m afraid that
fool Quincunx is at the bottom of it.”</p>

<p>“Something must be done! Something must be
done!” wailed Vennie.</p>

<p>“<i>Sustinuit anima mea in verbo ejus!</i>” muttered Mr.
Taxater. “<i>Speravit anima mea in Domino.</i>”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind so much the state he’s in,”
continued Luke, “if I didn’t remember how my
mother went. She got just like this before she died.
It’s true my father was a brute to her. But this
different kind of blow seems to have just the same
effect upon James. Fool that I am, I must needs
start a miserable quarrel with him when he was most
worried. If anything happens, I tell you I shall feel
I’m responsible for the whole thing, and no one else!”</p>

<p>All this while Mr. Taxater had remained silent,
his chin on the handle of his cane. At last he lifted
up his head.</p>

<p>“I think,” he began softly, “I should rather like a
word alone with Mr. Luke, Vennie. Perhaps you
wouldn’t mind wandering down the lane a step or
two? Then I can follow you; and we’ll leave this
young man to get his brother home.”</p>

<p>The girl rose obediently and pressed the youth’s
hand. “If anyone can help you,” she said with a
look of tender sympathy, “it is Mr. Taxater. He has
helped me in my trouble.”</p>

<p>As soon as Vennie was out of hearing the theologian
looked straight into Luke’s face.</p>

<p>“I have an idea,” he said, “that if any two people
can find a way out of this wretched business, it is
you and I together.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said Luke, seating himself by Mr.
Taxater’s side and glancing apprehensively towards
the church-porch; “I have tried what I can do with
Miss Romer, but she maintains that nothing she can
say will make any difference to Miss Traffio.”</p>

<p>“I fancy there is one thing, however, that would
make a difference to Mr. Quincunx,” remarked the
theologian significantly. “I am taking for granted,”
he added, “that it is this particular marriage which
weighs so heavily on your brother. He would
not suffer if he saw her wedded to a man she
loved?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Luke, “your idea is to appeal to
Quincunx. I’ve thought of that, too. But I’m
afraid it’s hopeless. He’s such an inconceivably
helpless person. Besides, he’s got no money.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we secured him the money?” said Mr.
Taxater.</p>

<p>Luke’s countenance momentarily brightened; but
the cloud soon settled on it again.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t get enough,” he said with a sigh.
“Unless,” he added, with a glimmer of humour, “you
or some other noble person have more cash to dispose
of than I fancy is at all likely! To persuade Quincunx
into any bold activity we should have to guarantee
him a comfortable annuity for the rest of his
life, and an assurance of his absolute security from
Romer’s vengeance. It would have to be enough
for Lacrima, too, you understand!”</p>

<p>The theologian shook the dew-drops from a large
crimson rose which hung within his reach.</p>

<p>“What precise sum would you suggest,” he asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
“as likely to be a sufficient inducement?”</p>

<p>The stone-carver meditated. “Those two could
live quite happily,” he remarked at last, “on two
hundred a year.”</p>

<p>“It is a large amount to raise,” said Mr. Taxater.
“I fear it is quite beyond my power and the power of
the Seldoms, even if we combined our efforts. How
right Napoleon was, when he said that in any campaign,
the first, second, and third requisite was
money!</p>

<p>“It only shows how foolish those critics of the
Catholic Church are, who blame her for laying stress
upon the temporal side of our great struggle against
evil. In this world, as things go, one always strikes
sooner or later against the barrier of money. The
money-question lies at the bottom of every subterranean
abuse and every hidden iniquity that we
unmask. It’s a wretched thing that it should be
so, but we have to accept it; until one of Vennie’s
angels”&mdash;he added in an undertone&mdash;“descends
to help us! Your poor brother began talking just
now about the power of stone. I referred him to
the Cross of our Lord&mdash;which is made of another
material!</p>

<p>“But unfortunately in the stress of this actual
struggle, you and I, my dear Andersen, find ourselves,
as you see, compelled to call in the help, not of wood,
but of gold. Gold, and gold alone, can furnish us
with the means of undermining these evil powers!”</p>

<p>The texture of Mr. Taxater’s mind was so nicely
inter-threaded with the opposite strands of metaphysical
and Machiavellian wisdom, that this discourse,
fantastic as it may sound to us, fell from
him as naturally as rain from a heavy cloud. Luke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
Andersen’s face settled into an expression of hopeless
gloom.</p>

<p>“The thing is beyond us, then,” he said. “I certainly
can’t provide an enormous sum like that.
James’ and my savings together only amount to a
few hundreds. And if no quixotic person can be
discovered to help us, we are bound hand and foot.</p>

<p>“Oh I should like,” he cried, “to make this place
ring and ting with our triumph over that damned
Romer!”</p>

<p>“<i>Quis est iste Rex gloriæ?</i>” muttered the Theologian.
“<i>Dominus fortis et potens; Dominus potens in prœlio.</i>”</p>

<p>“I shall never dare,” went on the stone-carver,
“to get my brother away into a home. The least
thought of such a thing would drive him absolutely
out of his mind. He’ll have to be left to drift about
like this, talking madly to everyone he meets, till
something terrible happens to him. God! I could
howl with rage, to think how it all might be saved if
only that ass Quincunx had a little gall!”</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater tapped the young man’s wrist with
his white fingers. “I think we can put gall into him
between us,” he said. “I think so, Andersen.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got some idea, sir!” cried Luke, looking
at the theologian. “For Heaven’s sake, let’s have
it! I am completely at the end of my tether.”</p>

<p>“This American who is engaged to Gladys is immensely
rich, isn’t he?” enquired Mr. Taxater.</p>

<p>“Rich?” answered Luke. “That’s not the word
for it! The fellow could buy the whole of Leo’s
Hill and not know the difference.”</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater was silent, fingering the gold cross
upon his watch-chain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>“It remains with yourself then,” he remarked at
last.</p>

<p>“What!” cried the astonished Luke.</p>

<p>“I happen to be aware,” continued the diplomatist,
calmly, “that there is a certain fact which our friend
from Ohio would give half his fortune to know. He
certainly would very willingly sign the little document
for it, that would put Mr. Quincunx and Miss
Traffio into a position of complete security. It is
only a question of ‘the terrain of negotiation,’ as we
say in our ecclesiastical circles.”</p>

<p>Luke Andersen’s eyes opened very widely, and the
amazement of his surprise made him look more like
an astounded faun than ever&mdash;a faun that has
come bolt upon some incredible triumph of civilization.</p>

<p>“I will be quite plain with you, young man,” said
the theologian. “It has come to my knowledge
that you and Gladys Romer are more than friends;
have been more than friends, for a good while past.</p>

<p>“Do not wave your hand in that way! I am not
speaking without evidence. I happen to know as
a positive fact that this girl is neither more nor less
than your mistress. I am also inclined to believe&mdash;though
of this, of course, I cannot be sure&mdash;that, as
a result of this intrigue, she is likely, before the
autumn is over, to find herself in a position of considerable
embarrassment. It is no doubt, with a
view to covering such embarrassment&mdash;you understand
what I mean, Mr. Andersen?&mdash;that she is
making preparations to have her marriage performed
earlier than was at first intended.”</p>

<p>“God!” cried the astounded youth, losing all self-possession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
“how, under the sun, did you get to
know this?”</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater smiled. “We poor controversialists,” he
said, “have to learn, in self-defence, certain innocent
arts of observation. I don’t think that you and your
mistress,” he added, “have been so extraordinarily discreet,
that it needed a miracle to discover your secret.”</p>

<p>Luke Andersen recovered his equanimity with a vigorous
effort. “Well?” he said, rising from his seat and
looking anxiously at his brother, “what then?”</p>

<p>As he uttered these words the young stone-carver’s
mind wrestled in grim austerity with the ghastly
hint thrown out by his companion. He divined with
an icy shock of horror the astounding proposal that
this amazing champion of the Faith was about to
unfold. He mentally laid hold of this proposal as a
man might lay hold upon a red-hot bar of iron.
The interior fibres of his being hardened themselves
to grasp without shrinking its appalling treachery.</p>

<p>Luke had it in him, below his urbane exterior, to
rend and tear away every natural, every human
scruple. He had it in him to be able to envisage,
with a shamelessness worthy of some lost soul of the
Florentine’s Inferno, the fire-scorched walls of such a
stark dilemma. The palpable suggestion which now
hung, as it were, suspended in the air between them,
was a suggestion he was ready to grasp by the throat.</p>

<p>The sight of his brother’s gaunt figure, every line of
which he knew and loved so well, turned his conscience
to adamant. Sinking into the depths of his soul, as a
diver might sink into an ice-cold sea, he felt that there
was literally <em>nothing</em> he would not do, if his dear Daddy
James could be restored to sanity and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>Gladys? He would walk over the bodies of a hundred
Gladyses, if that way, and that alone, led to
his brother’s restoration!</p>

<p>“What then?” he repeated, turning a bleak but
resolute face upon Mr. Taxater.</p>

<p>The theologian continued: “Why, it remains for
you, or for someone deputed by you, to reveal to our
unsuspecting American exactly how his betrothed has
betrayed him. I have no doubt that in the disturbance
this will cause him we shall have no difficulty
in securing his aid in this other matter. It
would be a natural, an inevitable revenge for him to
take. Himself a victim of these Romers, what more
appropriate, what more suitable, than that he should
help us in liberating their other victims? If he is as
wealthy as you say, it would be a mere bagatelle for
him to set our good Quincunx upon his feet forever, and
Lacrima with him! It is the kind of thing it would
naturally occur to him to do. It would be a revenge;
but a noble revenge. He would leave Nevilton then,
feeling that he had left his mark; that he had made
himself felt. Americans like to make themselves felt.”</p>

<p>Luke’s countenance, in spite of his interior acquiescence,
stiffened into a haggard mask of dismay.</p>

<p>“But this is beyond anything one has ever heard of!”
he protested, trying in vain to assume an air of levity. “It
is beyond everything. Actually to convey, to the very
man one’s girl is going to marry, the news of her seduction!
Actually to ‘coin her for drachmas,’ as it says
somewhere! It’s a monstrous thing, an incredible
thing!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit more monstrous than your original sin
in seducing the girl,” said Mr. Taxater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is the usual trick,” he went on sternly, “of
you English people! You snatch at your little pleasures,
without any scruple, and feel yourselves quite
honourable. And then, directly it becomes a question
of paying for them, by any form of public confession,
you become fastidiously scrupulous.”</p>

<p>“But to give one’s girl away, to betray her in this
shameless manner oneself! It seems to me the ultimate
limit of scurvy meanness!”</p>

<p>“It only seems to you so, because the illusion of
chivalry enters into it; in other words, because public
opinion would condemn you! This honourable
shielding of the woman we have sinned with, at
every kind of cost to others, has been the cause of
endless misery. Do you think you are preparing a
happy marriage for your Gladys in your ‘honourable’
reticence? By saving her from this union with Mr.
Dangelis&mdash;whom, by the way, she surely cannot love,
if she loves you&mdash;you will be doing her the best service
possible. Even if she refuses to make you her husband
in his place&mdash;and I suppose her infatuation would
stop at that!&mdash;there are other ways, besides marriage,
of hiding her embarrassed condition. Let her travel
for a year till her trouble is well over!”</p>

<p>Luke Andersen reflected in silence, his drooping figure
indicating a striking collapse of his normal urbanity.</p>

<p>At last he spoke. “There may be something in
what you suggest,” he remarked slowly. “Obviously,
<em>I</em> can’t be the one,” he added, after a further pause,
“to strike this astounding bargain with the American.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not,” said the theologian, with
a certain maliciousness in his tone, “I don’t see why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
not. You have been the one to commit the sin;
you ought naturally to be the one to perform the
penance.”</p>

<p>The luckless youth distorted his countenance into
such a wry grimace, that he caused it to resemble
the stone gargoyles which protruded their lewd
tongues from the church roof above them.</p>

<p>“It’s a scurvy thing to do, all the same,” he
muttered.</p>

<p>“It is only relatively&mdash;‘scurvy,’ as you call it,”
replied Mr. Taxater. “In an absolute sense, the
‘scurviness’ would be to let your Gladys deceive
an honest man and make herself unhappy for life,
simply to save you two from any sort of exposure.
But as a matter of fact, I am <em>not</em> inclined to place
this very delicate piece of negotiation in your hands.
It would be so fatally easy for you&mdash;under the circumstances&mdash;to
make some precipitate blunder that
would spoil it all.</p>

<p>“Don’t think,” he went on, observing the face of his
interlocutor relapsing into sudden cheerfulness, “that I
let you off this penance because of its unchivalrous
character. You break the laws of chivalry quite as completely
by putting me into the possession of the facts.</p>

<p>“I shall, of course,” he added, “require from you
some kind of written statement. The thing must be
put upon an unimpeachable ground.”</p>

<p>Luke Andersen’s relief was not materially modified
by this demand. He began to fumble in his
pocket for his cigarette-case.</p>

<p>“The great point to be certain of,” continued
Mr. Taxater, “is that Quincunx and Lacrima will
accept the situation, when it is thus presented to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
them. But I don’t think we need anticipate any
difficulty. In case of Dangelis’ saying anything to
Mr. Romer, though I do not for a moment imagine
he will, it would be well if you and your brother
were prepared to move, if need were, to some other
scene of action. There is plenty of demand for skilled
workmen like yourselves, and you have no ties here.”</p>

<p>The young man made a deprecatory movement
with his hands.</p>

<p>“We neither of us should like that, very much,
sir. James and I are fonder of Nevilton than you
might imagine.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” responded the theologian, “we can
discuss that another time. Such a thing may not be
necessary. I am glad to see, my friend,” he added,
“that whatever wrong you have done, you are willing
to atone for it. So I trust our little plan will work
out successfully. Perhaps you will look in, tomorrow
night? I shall be at leisure then, and we can make
our arrangements. Well, Heaven protect you, ‘<i>a sagitta
volante in die, a negotio perambulante in tenebris</i>.’”</p>

<p>He crossed himself devoutly as he spoke, and giving
the young man a friendly wave of the hand, and
an encouraging smile, let himself out through the
gate and proceeded to follow the patient Vennie.</p>

<p>He overtook his little friend somewhere not far
from the lodge of that admirable captain, whose
neatly-cut laurel hedge had witnessed, according to
the loquacious Mrs. Fringe, the strange encounter
between Jimmy Pringle and his Maker. Vennie
was straying slowly along by the hedge-side, trailing
her hand through the tall dead grasses. Hearing Mr.
Taxater’s footsteps, she turned eagerly to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” she asked, “what does Luke say about his
brother? Is it as bad as we feared?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t think,” responded the theologian,
“any more than I do, that the thing has gone further
than common hallucination.”</p>

<p>“And Lacrima&mdash;poor little Lacrima!&mdash;have you
decided what we must do to intervene in her case?”</p>

<p>“I think it may be said,” responded the scholar
gravely, “that we have hit upon an effective way of
stopping that marriage. But perhaps it would be
pleasanter and easier for you to remain at present
in ignorance of our precise plan. I know,” he added,
smiling, “you do not care for hidden conspiracies.”</p>

<p>Vennie frowned. “I don’t see why,” she said,
“there should be anything hidden about it! It seems
to me, the thing is so abominable, that one would
only have to make it public, to put an end to it
completely.</p>

<p>“I hope”&mdash;she clasped her hands&mdash;“I do hope,
you are not fighting the evil one with the weapons
of the evil one? If you are, I am sure it will end
unhappily. I am sure and certain of it!”</p>

<p>She spoke with a fervour that seemed almost
prophetic; and as she did so, she unconsciously
waved&mdash;with a pathetic little gesture of protest&mdash;the
bunch of dead grasses which she held in her hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater walked gravely by her side; his profile,
in its imperturbable immobility, resembling the
mask of some great mediæval ecclesiastic. The only
reply he made to her appeal was to quote the famous
Psalmodic invocation: “<i>Nisi Dominus ædificaverit domum,
in vanum laboraverunt qui ædificant eam.</i>”</p>

<p>It would have been clear to anyone who had overheard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
his recent conversation with Luke, and now
watched his reception of Vennie’s instinctive protest,
that whatever the actions of this remarkable man
were, they rested upon a massive foundation of unshakable
philosophy.</p>

<p>There was little further conversation between
them; and at the vicarage gate, they separated with
a certain air of estrangement. With undeviating
feminine clairvoyance, Vennie was persuaded in the
depths of her mind that whatever plan had been hit
upon by the combined wits of the theologian and
Luke, it was one whose nature, had she known it,
would have aroused her most vehement condemnation.
Nor in this persuasion will the reader of our curious
narrative regard her as far astray from the truth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two brothers were also returning
slowly along the road to Nevilton. Had Mr. Clavering,
whose opinion of the younger stone-carver was
probably lower than that of any of his other critics,
seen Luke during this time, he might have formed a
kindlier judgment of him. Nothing could have
exceeded the tact and solicitude with which he
guided the conversation into safe channels. Nothing
could have surpassed, in affectionate tenderness, the
quick, anxious glances he every now and then cast
upon his brother. There are certain human expressions
which flit suddenly across the faces of men and
women, which reveal, with the seal of absolute authenticity,
the depth of the emotion they betray.
Such a flitting expression, of a love almost maternal
in its passionate depth, crossed the face of Luke
Andersen at more than one stage of their homeward
walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>James seemed, on the whole, rather better than
earlier in the day. The most ominous thing he did
was to begin a long incoherent discourse about the
rooks which kept circling over their heads on their
way to the tall trees of Wild Pine. But this particular
event of the rooks’ return to their Nevilton roosting-place
was a phase of the local life of that spot
calculated to impress even perfectly sane minds
with romantic suggestion. It was always a sign of
the breaking up of the year’s pristine bloom when
they came, a token of the not distant approach of
the shorter equinoctial days. They flew hither, these
funereal wayfarers, from far distant feeding-grounds.
They did not nest in the Nevilton woods. Nevilton
was to them simply a habitation of sleep. Many of
them never even saw it, except in its morning and
evening twilight. The place drew them to it at night-fall,
and rejected them at sunrise. In the interval
they remained passive and unconscious&mdash;huddled
groups of black obscure shapes, tossed to and fro in
their high branches, their glossy heads full of dreams
beyond the reach of the profoundest sage. Before
settling down to rest, however, it was their custom,
even on the stormiest evenings, to sweep round,
above the roofs of the village, in wide airy circles of
restless flight, uttering their harsh familiar cries.
Sailing quietly on a peaceful air or roughly buffeted
by rainy gusts of wind&mdash;those westerly winds that
are so wild and intermittent in this corner of England&mdash;these
black tribes of the twilight give a character
to their places of favourite resort which resembles
nothing else in the world. The cawing of rooks is
like the crying of sea-gulls. It is a sound that more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
than anything flings the minds of men back to
“old unhappy far-off things.”</p>

<p>The troubled soul of the luckless stone-carver went
tossing forth on this particular night of embalmed
stillness, driven in the track of those calmly circling
birds, on the gust of a thought-tempest more formidable
than any that the fall of the leaves could
bring. But the devoted passion of the younger
brother followed patiently every flight it took; and
by the time they had reached the vicarage-gate, and
turned down the station-hill towards their lodging,
the wild thoughts had fallen into rest, and like the
birds in the dusk of their sheltering branches, were
soothed into blessed forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Luke had recourse, before they reached their dwelling,
to the magic of old memories; and the end of
that unforgettable day was spent by the two brothers
in summoning up childish recollections, and in evoking
the images and associations of their earliest compacts
of friendship.</p>

<p>When he left his brother asleep and stood for a
while at the open window, Luke prayed a vague
heathen prayer to the planetary spaces above his
head. A falling star happened to sweep downward
at that moment behind the dark pyramid of Nevilton
Mount, and this natural phenomenon seemed to his
excited nerves a sort of elemental answer to his invocation;
as if it had been the very bolt of Sagittarius,
the Archer, aimed at all the demons that
darkened his brother’s soul!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">VOICES BY THE WAY</span></h2>

<p>The morning which followed James Andersen’s
completion of his work in Athelston church-porch,
was one of the loveliest of the season.
The sun rose into a perfectly cloudless sky. Every
vestige of mist had vanished, and the half-cut corn-fields
lay golden and unshadowed in the translucent
air. Over the surface of every upland path, the
little waves of palpable ether vibrated and quivered.
The white roads gleamed between their tangled hedges
as if they had been paved with mother-of-pearl. The
heat was neither oppressive nor sultry. It penetrated
without burdening, and seemed to flow forth upon
the earth, as much from the general expanse of the
blue depths as from the limited circle of the solar
luminary.</p>

<p>James Andersen seemed more restored than his
brother had dared to hope. They went to their
work as usual; and from the manner in which the
elder stone-carver spoke to his mates and handled
his tools, none would have guessed at the mad fancies
which had so possessed him during the previous
days.</p>

<p>Luke was filled with profound happiness and relief.
It is true that, like a tiny cloud upon the surface of
this clear horizon, the thought of his projected betrayal
of his mistress remained present with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
But in the depths of his heart he knew that he would
have betrayed twenty mistresses, if by that means
the brother of his soul could be restored to sanity.</p>

<p>He had already grown completely weary of Gladys.
The clinging and submissive passion with which the
proud girl had pursued him of late had begun to
irritate his nerves. More than once&mdash;especially
when her importunities interrupted his newer pleasures&mdash;he
had found himself on the point of hating
her. He was absolutely cynical&mdash;and always had
been&mdash;with regard to the ideal of faithfulness in
these matters. Even the startling vision of the
indignant Dangelis putting into her hands&mdash;as he
supposed the American might naturally do&mdash;the
actual written words with which he betrayed her,
only ruffled his equanimity in a remote and even
half-humorous manner. He recalled her contemptuous
treatment of him on the occasion of their first
amorous encounter and it was not without a certain
malicious thrill of triumph that he realized how
thoroughly he had been revenged.</p>

<p>He had divined without difficulty on the occasion
of their return from Hullaway that Gladys was on
the point of revealing to him the fact that she was
likely to have a child; and since that day he had
taken care to give her little opportunity for such
revelations. Absorbed in anxiety for James, he
had been anxious to postpone this particular crisis
between them till a later occasion.</p>

<p>The situation, nevertheless, whenever he had
thought of it, had given him, in spite of its complicated
issues, an undeniable throb of satisfaction.
It was such a complete, such a triumphant victory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
over Mr. Romer. Luke in his heart had an unblushing
admiration for the quarry-owner, whose
masterly attitude towards life was not so very different
from his own. But this latent respect for his
employer rather increased than diminished his complacency
in thus striking him down. The remote
idea that, in the whirligig of time, an offspring of
his own should come to rule in Nevilton house&mdash;as
seemed by no means impossible, if matters were
discreetly managed&mdash;was an idea that gave him a
most delicate pleasure.</p>

<p>As they strolled back to breakfast together, across
the intervening field, and admired the early dahlias
in the station-master’s garden, Luke took the risk
of testing his brother on the matter of Mr. Quincunx.
He was anxious to be quite certain of his ground
here, before he had his interview with the tenant
of the Gables.</p>

<p>“I wish,” he remarked casually, “that Maurice
Quincunx would show a little spirit and carry Lacrima
off straight away.”</p>

<p>James looked closely at him. “If he would,” he
said, “I’d give him every penny I possess and I’d
work day and night to help them! O Luke&mdash;Luke!”
he stretched out his arm towards Leo’s Hill and pronounced
what seemed like a vow before the Eumenides
themselves; “if I could make her happy, if I
could only make her happy, I would be buried tomorrow
in the deepest of those pits.”</p>

<p>Luke registered his own little resolution in the
presence of this appeal to the gods. “Gladys?
What is Gladys to me compared with James? All
girls are the same. They all get over these things.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile James Andersen was repeating in a
low voice to himself the quaint name of his rival.</p>

<p>“He is an ash-root, a tough ash-root,” he muttered.
“And that’s the reason he has been chosen.
There’s nothing in the world but the roots of trees
that can undermine the power of Stone! The trees
can do it. The trees will do it. What did that
Catholic say? He said it was Wood against Stone.
That’s the reason I can’t help her. I have worked
too long at Stone. I am too near Stone. That’s
the reason Quincunx has been chosen. She and I
are under the power of Stone, and we can’t resist it,
any more than the earth can! But ash-tree roots
can undermine anything. If only she would take
my money, if only she would.”</p>

<p>This last aspiration was uttered in a voice loud
enough for Luke to hear; and it may be well believed
that it fortified him all the more strongly in his
dishonourable resolution.</p>

<p>During breakfast James continued to show signs
of improvement. He talked of his mother, and
though his conversation was sprinkled with somewhat
fantastic imagery, on the whole it was rational
enough.</p>

<p>While the meal was still in progress, the younger
brother observed through the window the figure of
a woman, moving oddly backwards and forwards
along their garden-hedge, as if anxious at the same
time to attract and avoid attention. He recognized
her in a moment as the notorious waif of the neighborhood,
the somewhat sinister Witch-Bessie. He
made an excuse to his brother and slipped out to
speak to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>Witch-Bessie had grown, if possible, still more
dehumanized since when two months ago she had
cursed Gladys Romer. Her skin was pallid and
livid as parchment. The eyes which stared forth
from her wrinkled expressionless face were of a dull
glaucous blue, like the inside of certain sun-bleached
sea-shells. She was dressed in a rough sack-cloth
petticoat, out of which protruded her stockingless
feet, only half concealed by heavy labourer’s boots,
unlaced and in large holes. Over her thin shoulders
she wore a ragged woolen shawl which served the office
not only of a garment, but also of a wallet; for, in
the folds of it, were even now observable certain
half-eaten pieces of bread, and bits of ancient cheese,
which she had begged in her wanderings. In one of
her withered hands she held a large bunch of magenta-coloured,
nettle-like flowers, of the particular species
known to botanists as marsh-wound-wort. As soon
as Luke appeared she thrust these flowers into his
arms.</p>

<p>“Gathered ’un for ’ee,” she whispered, in a thin
whistling voice, like the soughing of wind in a bed
of rushes. “They be capital weeds for them as be
moon-smitten. Gathered ’un, up by Seven Ashes,
where them girt main roads do cross. Take ’un,
mister; take ’un and thank an old woman wot loves
both of ’ee, as heretofore she did love your long-sufferin’
mother. I were bidin’ down by Minister’s
back gate, expectin’ me bit of oddments, when they
did tell I, all sudden-like, as how he’d been taken,
same as <em>she</em> was.”</p>

<p>“It’s most kind of you, Bessie,” said Luke graciously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
“You and I have always been good friends.”</p>

<p>The old woman nodded. “So we be, mister, and
let none say the contrary! I’ve a dangled ’ee, afore-now,
in these very arms. Dost mind how ’ee drove
that ramping girt dog out of Long-Load Barton when
the blarsted thing were for laying hold of I?”</p>

<p>“But what must I do with these?” asked the
stone-carver, holding the bunch of pungent scented
flowers to his face.</p>

<p>“That’s wot I was just a-going to tell ’ee,” whispered
the old woman solemnly. “I suppose <em>he’s</em>
in there now, eh? Let ’un be, poor man. Let ’un
be. May-be the Lord’s only waitin’ for these ’ere
weeds to mend ’is poor swimey wits. You do as I
do tell ’ee, mister, and ’twill be all smoothed out,
as clean as church floor. You take these blessed
weeds,&mdash;‘viviny-lobs’ my old mother did call ’em&mdash;and
hang ’em to dry till they be dead and brown.
Then doddy a sprinkle o’ good salt on ’em, and dip
’em in clear water. Be you followin’ me, mister
Luke?”</p>

<p>The young man nodded.</p>

<p>“Then wot you got to do, is for to strike ’em
against door-post, and as you strikes ’em, you says,
same as I says now.” And Witch-Bessie repeated
the following archaic enchantment.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Marshy hollow woundy-wort,</div>
<div class="verse">Growing on the holy dirt,</div>
<div class="verse">In the Mount of Calvary</div>
<div class="verse">There was thou found.</div>
<div class="verse">In the name of sweet Jesus</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>Luke listened devoutly to these mysterious words,
and repeated them twice, after the old woman.
Their two figures, thus concerted in magical tutelage,
might, for all the youth’s modern attire, have suggested
to a scholarly observer some fantastic heathen
scene out of Apuleius. The spacious August sunshine
lay splendid upon the fields about them, and
light-winged swallows skimmed the surface of the
glittering railway-line as though it had been a flowing
river.</p>

<p>When she was made assured in her mind that her
pupil fully understood the healing incantation, Witch-Bessie
shuffled off without further words. Her
face, as she resumed her march in the direction of
Hullaway, relapsed into such corpse-like rigidity,
that, but for her mechanical movement, one might
have expected the shameless flocks of starlings who
hovered about her, to settle without apprehension
upon her head.</p>

<p>The two brothers labored harmoniously side by
side in their work-shop all that forenoon. It was
Saturday, and their companions were anxious to
throw down their tools and clear out of the place on
the very stroke of the one o’clock bell.</p>

<p>James and Luke were both engaged upon a new
stone font, the former meticulously chipping out its
angle-mouldings, and the latter rounding, with chisel
and file, the capacious lip of its deep basin. It was
a cathedral font, intended for use in a large northern
city.</p>

<p>Luke could not resist commenting to his brother,
in his half-humorous half-sentimental way, upon the
queer fact that they two&mdash;their heads full of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
own anxieties and troubles&mdash;should be thus working
upon a sacred font which for countless generations,
perhaps as long as Christianity lasted, would be associated
with so many strange and mingled feelings of
perturbation and hope.</p>

<p>“It’s a comical idea,” he found himself saying,
though the allusion was sufficiently unwise, “this
idea of Gladys’ baptism.”</p>

<p>He regretted his words the moment they were out
of his mouth; but James received them calmly.</p>

<p>“I once heard,” he answered, “I think it was on
the sands at Weymouth, two old men discussing
quite reverently and gravely whether an infant,
baptized before it was born, would be brought under
the blessing of the Church. I thought, as I listened
to them, how vulgar and gross-minded our age had
become, that I should have to tremble with alarm
lest any flippant passer-by should hear their curious
speculation. It seemed to me a much more important
matter to discuss, than the merits of the black-faced
Pierrots who were fooling and howling just
beyond. This sort of seriousness, in regard to the
strange borderland of the Faith, has always seemed
to me a sign of pathetic piety, and the very reverse
of anything blasphemous.”</p>

<p>Luke had made an involuntary movement when
his brother’s anecdote commenced. The calmness
and reasonableness with which James had spoken
was balm and honey to the anxious youth; but he
could not help speculating in his heart whether his
brother was covertly girding at him. Did he, he
wondered, realize how far things had gone between
him and the fair-haired girl?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s the sort of question, at any rate,” he remarked
rather feebly, “that would interest our friend Sir
Thomas Browne. Do you remember how we read
together that amazing passage in the Urn Burial?”</p>

<p>“‘But the iniquity of oblivion,’” quoted James in
answer, “‘blindly scattereth her Poppy, and deals
with the memory of men without distinction to merit
of perpetuity. Who can but pity the founder of the
Pyramids? Herostratus lives that burnt the temple
of Diana; he is almost lost that built it. Time has
spared the epitaph of Hadrian’s Horse, confounded
that of himself. In vain we compute our felicities by
the advantage of our good names, since bad have
equal durations; and Thersites is like to live as long
as Agamemnon without the favour of the everlasting
register.… Darkness and light divide the course of
time, and oblivion shares with memory a great part
even of our living beings; we slightly remember our
felicities and the smartest strokes of affliction leave
but short smart upon us. To weep into Stones are
fables.’”</p>

<p>He pronounced these last words with a slow and
emphatic intonation.</p>

<p>“Fables?” he repeated, resting his hand upon the
rim of the font, and lowering his voice, so as not to
be heard by the men outside. “He calls them fables
because he has never worked as we do&mdash;day in and
day out&mdash;among nothing else. The reason he says
that to weep into Stones are fables is that his own
life, down at that pleasant Norwich, was such a
happy one. To weep into Stones! He means, of
course, that when you have endured more than you
can bear, you become a Stone. But that is no fable!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
Or if it was once, it isn’t so today. Mr. Taxater said
the Stone-Age was over. In my opinion, Luke, the
Stone-Age is only now beginning. The reason of
that is, that whereas, in former times, Stone was
moulded by men; now, men are moulded by Stone.
We have receded, instead of advancing; and the
iniquity of Time which turned animals into men, is
now turning men back into the elements!”</p>

<p>Luke cursed bitterly in his heart the rhythmic incantations
of the old Norwich doctor. He had been
thinking of a very different passage from that which
his brother recalled. To change the conversation he
asked how James wished to spend their free afternoon.</p>

<p>Andersen’s tone changed in a moment, and he
grew rational and direct. “I am going for a walk,”
he said, “and I think perhaps, if you don’t mind,
I’ll go alone. My brain feels clouded and oppressed.
A long walk ought to clear it. I think it will clear
it; don’t you?” This final question was added
rather wistfully.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it will. Oh, it certainly will! I expect
the sun has hit you a bit; or perhaps, as Mr. Taxater
would say, your headache is a relative one, due to
my dragging in such things as Urn Burial. But I
don’t quite like your going alone, Daddy James.”</p>

<p>The elder brother smiled affectionately at him, but
went on quietly with his work without replying.</p>

<p>When they had finished their mid-day meal they
both loitered out into the field together, smoking and
chatting. The afternoon promised to be as clear and
beautiful as the morning, and Luke’s spirits rose high.
He hoped his brother, at the last moment, would not
have the heart to reject his company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>The fineness of the weather, combined with the
Saturday half-holiday, was attracting abroad all
manner of Nevilton folk. Lads and maids, in merry
noisy groups, passed and repassed. The platform of
the little station was crowded with expectant passengers
waiting for the train to Yeoborough.</p>

<p>As the brothers stood together, carelessly turning
over with their sticks the fetid heads of a patch of
meadow fungi, they observed two separate couples
issuing, one after another, from the little swing-gate
that opened on the level-crossing. They recognized
both couples almost simultaneously. The first pair
consisted of Annie Bristow and Phyllis Santon; the
second of Vennie Seldom and Mr. Clavering.</p>

<p>The two girls proceeded, arm-in-arm, up the sloping
path that led in the direction of Hullaway. Vennie
and Mr. Clavering advanced straight towards the
brothers. Luke had time to wonder vaguely whether
this conjunction of Vennie and her Anglican pastor
had any connection with last night’s happenings.</p>

<p>He was too closely associated with that Gargantuan
gossip, Mrs. Fringe, not to be aware that for many
weeks past Miss Seldom and the young clergyman had
studiously avoided one another. That they should
now be walking together, indicated, to his astute
mind, either a quarrel between the young lady and
Mr. Taxater, or an estrangement between the vicar
and Gladys. Luke was the sort of philosopher who
takes for granted that in all these situations it is love
for love, or hate for hate, which propels irresistibly
the human mechanism and decides the most trifling
incidents.</p>

<p>James looked angry and embarrassed at the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
of the pair; but they were too close upon
them for any escape to be possible.</p>

<p>“How are you today, Andersen?” began Mr.
Clavering, with his usual well-meaning but indiscreet
impulsiveness. “Miss Seldom tells me she was
nervous about you last night. She was afraid you
were working too hard.”</p>

<p>Vennie gave him a quick reproachful glance, and
made a deprecatory movement with her hands. “Are
all men,” she thought, “either without scruple or
without common-sense?”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see that I was quite mistaken,” she
hastened to add. “You don’t look at all tired today,
Mr. Andersen. And no wonder, with such a perfectly
lovely afternoon! And how are you, Mr. Luke? I
haven’t been down to see how that Liverpool font is
getting on, for ever so long. I believe you’ll end by
being quite as famous as your father.”</p>

<p>Luke received this compliment in his most courtly
manner. He was always particularly anxious to
impress persons who belonged to the “real” upper
classes with his social sang-froid.</p>

<p>He was at this precise moment, however, a little
agitated by the conduct of the two young people who
had just passed up the meadow. Instead of disappearing
into the lane beyond, they continued to loiter
at the gate, and finally, after an interlude of audible
laughter and lively discussion, they proceeded to
stretch themselves upon the grass. The sight of two
amiable young women, both so extremely well known
to him, and both in evident high spirits, thus enjoying
the sunshine, filled our faun-like friend’s mind with
the familiar craving for frivolity. He caught Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
Clavering’s glance fixed gravely upon him. He also,
it appeared, was not oblivious of the loitering villagers.</p>

<p>“I think there are other members of your flock,
sir,” said James Andersen to the young vicar, “who
are at the present moment more in need of your help
than I am. What I need at this moment is air&mdash;air.
I should like to be able to wander over the
Quantocks this afternoon. Or better still, by the
edge of the sea! We all need more air than we get
here. It is too shut-in here&mdash;too shut-in and oppressive.
There’s too much stone about; and too much
clay. Yes, and the trees grow too close together.
Do you know, Miss Seldom, what I should like to do?
I should like to pull down all the houses&mdash;I mean
all the big houses&mdash;and cut down all the trees, and
then perhaps the wind would be free to blow. It’s
wind we want&mdash;all of us&mdash;wind and air to clear
our brains! Do you realize”&mdash;his voice once more
took that alarming tone of confidential secretiveness,
which had struck them so disagreeably the preceding
evening;&mdash;“do you realize that there are evil spirits
abroad in Nevilton, and that they come from the Hill
over there?” He pointed towards the Leonian escarpments
which could be plainly seen from where they
stood, slumbering in the splendid sunshine.</p>

<p>“It looks more like a sphinx than a lion today,
doesn’t it, Miss Seldom? Oh, I should like to tear it
up, bodily, from where it lies, and fling it into the
sea! It blocks the horizon. It blocks the path of
the west-wind. I tell you it is the burden that
weighs upon us all! But I shall conquer it yet;
I shall be master of it yet!” He was silent a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
seconds, while a look of supreme disappointment
clouded the face of his brother; and the two new-comers
gazed at him in alarm.</p>

<p>“I must start at once,” he exclaimed abruptly.
“I must get far, far off. It is air I need, air and the
west-wind! No,” he cried imperiously, when Luke
made a movement, as if to take leave of their companions.
“I must go alone. Alone! That is what I
must be today: alone&mdash;and on the hills!”</p>

<p>He turned impatiently as he spoke; and without
another word strode off towards the level-crossing.</p>

<p>“Surely you will not let him go like that, Mr.
Andersen?” cried Vennie, in great distress.</p>

<p>“It would do no good,” replied Luke, watching his
brother pass through the gate and cross the track.
“I should only make him much worse if I tried to
follow him. Besides, he wouldn’t let me. I don’t
think he’ll come to any harm. I should have a
different instinct about it if there were real danger.
Perhaps, as he says, a good long walk may really clear
his brain.”</p>

<p>“I do pray your instinct is to be relied on,” said
Vennie, anxiously watching the tall figure of the
stone-carver, as he ascended the vicarage hill.</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re not going to do your duty, Andersen,
I’m going to do mine!” exclaimed the vicar of
Nevilton, setting off, without further parley, in
pursuit of the fugitive.</p>

<p>“Stop! Mr. Clavering, I’ll come with you,” cried
Vennie. And she followed her impulsive friend
towards the gate.</p>

<p>As they ascended the hill together, keeping Andersen
in sight, Clavering remarked to his companion, “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
believe that dissolute young reprobate refused to
look after his brother simply because he wanted to
talk to those two girls.”</p>

<p>“What two girls?” enquired Vennie.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see them?” muttered the clergyman
crossly. “The Bristow girl and little Phyllis Santon.
They were hanging about, waiting for him.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you are quite wrong,” replied Vennie.
“Luke may have his faults, but he is devoted&mdash;madly
devoted&mdash;to his brother.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” cried Clavering almost rudely. “I
know the man better than you do. He is entirely
selfish. He is a selfish, sensual pleasure-seeker! He
may be fond of his brother in his fashion, just because
he <em>is</em> his brother, and they have the same tastes; but
his one great aim is his own pleasure. He has been
the worst influence I have had to contend with, in
this whole village, for some time back!”</p>

<p>His voice trembled with rage as he spoke. It was
impossible, even for the guileless Vennie, not to help
wondering in her mind whether the violence of her
friend’s reprobation was not impelled by an emotion
more personal than public. Her unlucky knowledge
of what the nature of such an emotion might be did
not induce her to yield meekly to his argument.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he saw the people you speak of
any more than I did,” she said.</p>

<p>“Saw them?” cried the priest wrathfully, quickening
his pace, as Andersen disappeared round the
corner of the road, so that Vennie had to trot by his
side like a submissive child. “I saw the look he
fixed on them. I know that look of his! I tell you
he is the kind of man that does harm wherever he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
goes. He’s a lazy, sensual, young scoundrel. He
ought to be kicked out of the place.”</p>

<p>Vennie sighed deeply. Life in the world of men
was indeed a complicated and entangled matter. She
had turned, in her agitation about the stone-carver,
and in her reaction from Mr. Taxater’s reserve,
straight to the person she loved best of all; and this
was her reward,&mdash;a mere crude outburst of masculine
jealousy!</p>

<p>They rounded the corner by her own gate, where
the road to Athelston deviates at right angles. James
Andersen was no longer in sight.</p>

<p>“Where the devil has the man got to?” cried the
astonished clergyman, raging at himself for his ill-temper,
and raging at Vennie for having been the
witness of it.</p>

<p>The girl glanced up the Athelston road; and hastening
forward a few paces, scanned the stately slope of
the Nevilton west drive. The unfortunate man was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>From where they now stood, the whole length of
the village street was visible, almost as far as the
Goat and Boy. It was full of holiday-making
young people, but there was no sign of Andersen’s
tall and unmistakable figure.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is dreadful!” cried Vennie. “What are
we to do? Where can he have gone?”</p>

<p>Hugh Clavering looked angrily round. He was
experiencing that curious sense, which comes to the
best of men sometimes, of being the special and
selected object of providential mockery.</p>

<p>“There are only two ways,” he said. “Either he’s
slipped down through the orchards, along your wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
or he’s made off to Nevilton Mount! If that’s what
he’s done, he must be now behind that hedge, over
there. We should see him otherwise.”</p>

<p>Vennie gazed anxiously in the direction indicated.
“He can’t have gone into our garden?” she said.
“No, he’d never do that! He talked about air and
hills. I expect he’s where you say. Shall we go on?”</p>

<p>They hurried down the road until they reached a
gate, on the further side of the hedge which ran to
the base of Nevilton Mount. Here they entered the
field. There was no sign of the fugitive; but owing to
certain inequalities in the ground, and the intervention
of some large elm-trees, it was still quite possible
that he was only a few hundred yards in front of
them. They followed the line of the hedge with all
the haste they could; trusting, at every turn it made,
that they would discover him. In this manner they
very soon arrived at the base of the hill.</p>

<p>“I feel sure he’s somewhere in front of us!” muttered
Clavering. “How annoying it is! It was
outrageous of that young scoundrel to let him go like
this;&mdash;wandering about the country in that mad
state! If he comes to any harm, I shall see to it that
that young man is held responsible.”</p>

<p>“Quick!” sighed Vennie breathlessly, “we’d better
climb straight to the top. We <em>must</em> find him there!”</p>

<p>They scrambled over the bank and proceeded to
make their way as hurriedly as they could through
the entangled undergrowth. Hot and exhausted they
emerged at last upon the level summit. Here, the
grotesque little tower mocked at them with its impassive
grey surface. There was no sign of the man they
sought; but seated on the grass with their backs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
the edifice were the figures of the complacent Mr. Wone
and one of his younger children, engaged in the
agreeable occupation of devouring a water-melon.
The mouth and chin of the Christian Candidate were
bespattered with the luscious juice of this delectable
fruit, and laid out carefully upon a magazine on his
knees, was a pleasing arrangement of rind-peelings
and well-sucked pips.</p>

<p>Mr. Wone waved his hand in polite acknowledgment
of Clavering’s salute. He removed his hat to
Vennie, but apologized for not rising. “Taking a
little holiday, you observe!” he remarked with a
satisfied smile. “I see you also are inclined to
make the most of this lovely summer day.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t by any chance seen the elder Andersen,
have you?” enquired Clavering.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” replied the recumbent man. “I
suppose I cannot offer you a piece of melon, Miss
Seldom?”</p>

<p>The two baffled pursuers looked at one another in
hopeless disappointment.</p>

<p>“We’ve lost him,” muttered the priest. “He must
have gone through your orchard after all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wone did not miss this remark. “You were
looking for our good James? No. We haven’t seen
anything of him. No doubt he is with his brother
somewhere. I believe they usually spend their
Saturdays out at Hullaway.”</p>

<p>“When does the election come off, Mr. Wone?”
enquired Vennie, hastily, extremely unwilling that her
tactless companion should disclose the purpose of
their search.</p>

<p>“In a week’s time from next Monday,” replied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
Candidate. “This will be my last free day till then.
I have to make thirty speeches during the next seven
days. Our cause goes well. I believe, with God’s
great help, we are practically certain of victory. It
will be a great event, Miss Seldom, a great event.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clavering made a hopeless sign to Vennie,
indicative of the uselessness of any further steps to
retake the runaway.</p>

<p>“I think your side will win in the country generally,”
he remarked. “As to this district, I cannot
tell. Mr. Romer has strengthened himself considerably
by his action after the strike.”</p>

<p>The candidate placed a carefully selected piece of
fruit in his mouth, and called to his little boy, who
was scratching his initials with a knife upon the base
of the tower.</p>

<p>“He will be beaten all the same,” he said. “He
is bound to be beaten. The stars in their courses
must fight against a man like that. I feel it in the
air; in the earth; in these beautiful trees. I feel it
everywhere. He has challenged stronger powers than
you or me. He has challenged the majesty of God
Himself. I’ll give you the right”&mdash;he went on in a
voice that mechanically assumed a preacher’s tone&mdash;“to
call me a liar and a false prophet, if by this time,
in ten days, the oppressor of the poor does not find
himself crushed and beaten!”</p>

<p>“I am afraid right and wrong are more strangely
mixed in this world than all that, Mr. Wone,” Vennie
found herself saying, with a little weary glance over
the wide sun-bathed valleys extended at their feet.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, pardon me, young lady,” cried the
Candidate. “In this great cause there can be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
doubt, no question, no ambiguity. The evolution of
the human race has reached a point when the will of
God must reveal itself in the triumph of love and
liberty. Nothing else matters. All turns upon this.
That is why I feel that my campaign is more than a
political struggle. It is a religious struggle, and on
our side are the great moral forces that uphold the
world!”</p>

<p>Vennie’s exhausted nerves completely broke down
upon this.</p>

<p>“Shall we go?” she said, touching her companion
on the sleeve.</p>

<p>Clavering nodded, and bade the melon-eater “good
afternoon,” with a brusque gesture.</p>

<p>As they went off, he turned on his heel. “The will
of God, Mr. Wone, is only to be found in the obedient
reception of His sacraments.”</p>

<p>The Christian candidate opened his mouth with
amazement. “Those young people,” he thought to
himself, “are up to no good. They’ll end by becoming
papists, if they go on like this. It’s extraordinary
that the human mind should actually <em>prefer</em> slavery
to freedom!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the man whose mysterious evasion of
his pursuers had resulted in this disconcerting encounter
was already well-advanced on his way
towards the Wild Pine ridge. He had, as a matter of
fact, crossed the field between the West drive and
the Vicarage-garden, and skirting the orchards below
Nevilton House, had plunged into the park.</p>

<p>A vague hope of meeting Lacrima&mdash;an instinctive
rather than a conscious feeling&mdash;had led him in this
direction. Once in the park, the high opposing ridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
crowned with its sentinel-line of tall Scotch-firs,
arrested his attention and drew him towards it. He
crossed the Yeoborough road and ascended the incline
of Dead Man’s Lane.</p>

<p>As he passed the cottage of his rival, he observed
Mr. Quincunx energetically at work in his garden.
On this occasion the recluse was digging up, not weeds,
but young potatoes. He was in his shirt-sleeves and
looked hot and tired.</p>

<p>Andersen leaned upon the little gate and observed
him with curious interest. “Why isn’t she here?”
he muttered to himself. Then, after a pause: “He
is an ash-root. Let him drag that house down!
Why doesn’t he drag it down, with all its heavy
stones? And the Priory too? And the Church;&mdash;yes;
and the Church too! He burrows like a root.
He looks like a root. I must tell him all these things.
I must tell him why he has been chosen, and I have
been rejected!” He opened the gate forthwith and
advanced towards the potato-digger.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx might have struck the imagination
of a much less troubled spirit than that of the poor
stone-carver as having a resemblance to a root. His
form was at once knotted and lean, fibrous and
delicate. His face, by reason of his stooping position,
was suffused with a rich reddish tint, and his beard
was dusty and unkempt. He rose hastily, on observing
his visitor.</p>

<p>“People like you and me, James, are best by ourselves
at these holiday-times,” was his inhospitable
greeting. “You can help me with my potatoes if you
like. Or you can tell me your news as I work. Or
do you want to ask me any question?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>He uttered these final words in such a tone as the
Delphic oracle might have used, when addressing
some harassed refugee.</p>

<p>“Has <em>she</em> been up here today?” said the stone-carver.</p>

<p>“I like the way you talk,” replied the other.
“Why should we mention their names? When I say
people, I mean girls. When I say persons, I mean
girls. When I say young ladies, I mean girls. And
when you say ‘she’ you mean our girl.”</p>

<p>“Yours!” cried the demented man; “she is yours&mdash;not
ours. She is weighed down by this evil Stone,&mdash;weighed
down into the deep clay. What has she
to do with me, who have worked at the thing so long?”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx leant upon his hoe and surveyed the
speaker. It occurred to him at once that something
was amiss. “Good Lord!” he thought to himself,
“the fellow has been drinking. I must get him out of
this garden as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“She loves you,” Andersen went on, “because you
are like a root. You go deep into the earth and no
stone can resist you. You twine and twine and
twine, and pull them all down. They are all haunted
places, these houses and churches; all haunted and
evil! They make a man’s head ache to live in them.
They put voices into a man’s ears. They are as full
of voices as the sea is full of waves.”</p>

<p>“You are right there, my friend,” replied Mr.
Quincunx. “It’s only what I’ve always said. Until
people give up building great houses and great
churches, no one will ever be happy. We ought to
live in bushes and thickets, or in tents. My cottage
is no better than a bush. I creep into it at night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
and out again in the morning. If its thatch fell on
my head I should hardly feel it.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t feel it, you wouldn’t!” cried the
stone-carver. “And the reason of that is, that you
can burrow like a root. I shouldn’t feel it either, but
for a different reason.”</p>

<p>“I expect you’d better continue your walk,” remarked
Mr. Quincunx. “I never fuss myself about
people who come to see me. If they come, they
come. And when they go, they go.”</p>

<p>The stone-carver sighed and looked round him.
The sun gleamed graciously upon the warm earth,
danced and sparkled upon the windows of the cottage,
and made the beads of sweat on Mr. Quincunx’s brow
shine like diamonds.</p>

<p>“Do you think,” he said, while the potato-digger
turned to his occupation, “that happiness or unhappiness
predominates in this world?”</p>

<p>“Unhappiness!” cried the bearded man, glaring at
his acquaintance with the scowl of a goblin. “Unhappiness!
Unhappiness! Unhappiness! That is why
the only wise way to live is to avoid everything.
That’s what I always do. I avoid people, I avoid
possessions, I avoid quarrels, I avoid lust, and I
avoid love! My life consists in the art of avoiding
things.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t want happiness,” pleaded the obsessed
stone-carver. “And <em>her</em> love is enough. She only
wants to escape.”</p>

<p>“Why do you keep bringing Lacrima in?” cried
the recluse. “She is going to marry John Goring.
She is going to be mistress of the Priory.”</p>

<p>A convulsive shock of fury flashed across the face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
Andersen. He made a movement that caused his
interlocutor to step hurriedly backwards. But the
emotion passed as rapidly as it had come.</p>

<p>“You would avoid everything,” he said cunningly.
“You would avoid everything you hate, if someone&mdash;myself
for instance&mdash;or Luke&mdash;made it easy for you
to save her from these houses and these churches!
Luke will arrange it. He is not like us. He is wise.
He knows the world. And you will only have to go
on just as before, to burrow and twine! But you’ll
have done it. You’ll have saved her from them.
And then it will not matter how deep they bury me
in the quarries of Leo’s Hill!”</p>

<p>“Is he drunk? Or is he not drunk?” Mr. Quincunx
wondered. The news of Andersen’s derangement,
though it had already run like wild-fire through the
village, had not yet reached his ears. For the last
few days he had walked both to and from his office,
and had talked to no one.</p>

<p>A remarkable peculiarity in this curious potato-digger
was, however, his absolute and unvarying
candour. Mr. Quincunx was prepared to discuss his
most private concerns with any mortal or immortal
visitor who stepped into his garden. He would have
entered into a calm philosophical debate upon his
love-affairs with a tramp, with a sailor, with the post-man,
with the chimney-sweep, with the devil; or,
as in this case, with his very rival in his sweetheart’s
affection! There was really something touching and
sublime about this tendency of his. It indicated the
presence, in Mr. Quincunx, of a certain mystical
reverence for simple humanity, which completely
contradicted his misanthropic cynicism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly,” he remarked, on this occasion, forgetting,
in his interest in the subject, the recent
strange outburst of his companion. “Certainly, if
Lacrima and I had sufficient money to live upon, I
would be inclined to risk marrying. You would
advise me to, then; wouldn’t you, Andersen? Anyone
would advise me to, then. It would be absurd not
to do it. Though, all the same, there are always
great risks in two people living together, particularly
nervous people,&mdash;such as we are. But what do you
think, Andersen? Suppose some fairy god-mother did
give us this money, would you advise us to risk it?
Of course, we know, girls like a large house and a lot
of servants! She wouldn’t get that with me, because
I hate those things, and wouldn’t have them, even if
I could afford it. What would you advise, Andersen,
if some mad chance did make such a thing possible?
Would it be worth the risk?”</p>

<p>An additional motive, in the queerly constituted
mind of the recluse, for making this extraordinary
request, was the Pariah-like motive of wishing to
propitiate the stone-carver. Parallel with his humorous
love of shocking people, ran, through Mr. Quincunx’s
nature, the naive and innocent wish to win
them over to his side; and his method of realizing this
wish was to put himself completely at their mercy,
laying his meanest thoughts bare, and abandoning
his will to their will, so that for very shame they
could not find it in them to injure him, but were
softened, thrown off their guard, and disarmed. Mr.
Quincunx knew no restraint in these confessions by
the way, in these appeals to the voices and omens of
casual encounter. He grew voluble, and even shameless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
In quiet reaction afterwards, in the loneliness
of his cottage, he was often led to regret with gloomy
remorse the manner in which he had betrayed himself.
It was then that he found himself hating, with the
long-brooding hatred of a true solitary, the persons
to whom he had exposed the recesses of his soul. At
the moment of communicativeness, however, he was
never able to draw rein or come to a pause. If he
grew conscious that he was making a fool of himself,
a curious demonic impulse in him only pressed him
on to humiliate himself further.</p>

<p>He derived a queer inverted pleasure from thus
offering himself, stripped and naked, to the smiter.
It was only afterwards, in the long hours of his loneliness,
that the poison of his outraged pride festered
and fermented, and a deadly malice possessed him
towards the recipients of his confidences. There was
something admirable about the manner in which this
quaint man made, out of his very lack of resistant
power, a sort of sanctity of dependence. But this
triumph of weakness in him, this dissolution of the
very citadel of his being, in so beautiful and mystical
an abandonment to the sympathy of our common
humanity, was attended by lamentable issues in its
resultant hatred and malice. Had Mr. Quincunx
been able to give himself up to this touching candour
without these melancholy and misanthropic reactions,
his temper would have been very nearly the temper
of a saint; but the gall and wormwood of the hours
that followed, the corroding energy of the goblin of
malice that was born of such unnatural humiliations,
put a grievous gulf between him and the heavenly
condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>It must also be remembered, in qualification of the
outrageousness, one might almost say the indecency,
of his appeal to Andersen, that he had not in the
remotest degree realized the extent of the stone-carver’s
infatuation with the Italian. Neither physical
passion, nor ideal passion, were things that entered
into his view of the relations between the sexes.
Desire with him was of a strange and complicated
subtlety, generally diffused into a mild and brooding
sentiment. He was abnormally faithful, but at the
same time abnormally cold; and though, very often,
jealousy bit him like a viper, it was a jealousy of the
mind, not a jealousy of the senses.</p>

<p>What in other people would have been gross and
astounding cynicism, was in Mr. Quincunx a perfectly
simple and even childlike recognition of elemental
facts. He could sweep aside every conventional
mask and plunge into the very earth-mould of reality,
but he was quite unconscious of any shame, or any
merit, in so doing. He simply envisaged facts, and
stated the facts he envisaged, without the conventional
unction of worldly discretion. This being so,
it was in no ironic extravagance that he appealed to
Andersen, but quite innocently, and without consciousness
of anything unusual.</p>

<p>Of the two men, some might have supposed,
considering the circumstances, that it was Mr. Quincunx
who was mad, and his interlocutor who was
sane. On the other hand, it might be said that only
a madman would have received the recluse’s appeal
in the calm and serious manner in which Andersen
received it. The abysmal cunning of those who have
only one object in life, and are in sight of its attainment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
actuated the unfortunate stone-carver in his
attitude to his rival at this moment.</p>

<p>“If some fairy or some god,” he said, “did lift the
stone from her sepulchre and you from your sepulchre,
my advice to you and to her would be to go away,
to escape, to be free. You would be happy&mdash;you
would both be happy! And the reason of your
happiness would be that you would know the Devil
had been conquered. And you would know that,
because, by gathering all the stones in the world upon
my own head, and being buried beneath them, I
should have made a rampart higher than Leo’s Hill
to protect you from the Evil One!”</p>

<p>Andersen’s words were eager and hurried, and when
he had finished speaking, he surveyed Mr. Quincunx
with wild and feverish eyes. It was now borne in
for the first time upon that worthy philosopher, that
he was engaged in conversation with one whose wits
were turned, and a great terror took possession of him.
If the cunning of madmen is deep and subtle, it is
sometimes surpassed by the cunning of those who are
afraid of madmen.</p>

<p>“The most evil heap of stones I know in Nevilton,”
remarked Mr. Quincunx, moving towards his gate,
and making a slight dismissing gesture with his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
“is the heap in the Methodist cemetery. You know
the one I mean, Andersen? The one up by Seven
Ashes, where the four roads meet. It is just inside
the entrance, on the left hand. They throw upon it
all the larger stones they find when they dig the
graves. I have often picked up bits of bones there,
and pieces of skulls. It is an interesting place, a
very curious place, and quite easy to find. There
haven’t been many burials there lately, because most
of the Methodists nowadays prefer the churchyard.
But there was one last spring. That was the burial
of Glory Lintot. I was there myself, and saw her
put in. It’s an extraordinary place. Anyone who
likes to look at what people can write on tombstones
would be delighted with it.”</p>

<p>By this time, by means of a series of vague ushering
movements, such as he might have used to get rid of
an admirable but dangerous dog, Mr. Quincunx had
got his visitor as far as the gate. This he opened,
with as easy and natural an air as he could assume,
and stood ostentatiously aside, to let the unfortunate
man pass out.</p>

<p>James Andersen moved slowly into the road.
“Remember!” he said. “You will avoid everything
you hate! There’s more in the west-wind than you
imagine, these strange days. That’s why the rooks
are calling. Listen to them!”</p>

<p>He waved his hand and strode rapidly up the lane.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx gazed after the retreating figure till
it disappeared, and then returned wearily to his work.
He picked up his hoe and leaned heavily upon it,
buried in thought. Thus he remained for the space
of several minutes.</p>

<p>“He is right,” he muttered, raising his head at
last. “The rooks are beginning to gather. That
means another summer is over,&mdash;and a good thing,
too! I suppose I ought to have taken him back to
Nevilton. But he is right about the rooks.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">PLANETARY INTERVENTION</span></h2>

<p>The long summer afternoon was nearly over by
the time James Andersen reached the Seven
Ashes. The declining sun had sunk so low
that it was invisible from the spot where he stood,
but its last horizontal rays cast a warm ruddy light
over the tree-tops in the valley. The high and
exposed intersection of sandy lanes, which for time
immemorial had borne this title, was, at the epoch
which concerns us, no longer faithful to its name.</p>

<p>The ash-trees which Andersen now surveyed, with
the feverish glance of mental obsession, were not
seven in number. They were indeed only three; and,
of these three, one was no more than a time-worn
stump, and the others but newly-planted saplings.
Such as they were, however, they served well enough
to continue the tradition of the place, and their
presence enhanced with a note of added melancholy
the gloomy character of the scene.</p>

<p>Seven Ashes, with its cross-roads, formed indeed
the extreme northern angle of the high winding ridge
which terminated at Wild Pine. Approached from
the road leading to this latter spot,&mdash;a road darkened
on either hand by wind-swept Scotch-firs&mdash;it was
the sort of place where, in less civilized times, one
might have expected to encounter a threatening
highwayman, or at least to have stumbled upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
some sinister witch-figure stooping over an unholy
task or groping among the weeds. Even in modern
times and in bright sunshine the spot was not one
where a traveller was induced to linger upon his way
or to rest himself. When overcast, as it was at the
moment of Andersen’s approach, by the coming on of
twilight, it was a place from which a normal-minded
person would naturally be in haste to turn. There
was something ominous in its bleak exposure to the
four quarters of the sky, and something full of ghostly
suggestiveness in the gaping mouths of the narrow
lanes that led away from it.</p>

<p>There was, however, another and a much more
definite justification for the quickening, at this point,
of any wayfarer’s steps who knew the locality. A
stranger to the place, glancing across an empty field,
would have observed with no particular interest the
presence of a moderately high stone wall protecting
a small square enclosure. Were such a one acquainted
with the survivals of old usage in English villages, he
might have supposed these walls to shut in the now
unused space of what was formerly the local “pound,”
or repository for stray animals. Such travellers as
were familiar with Nevilton knew, however, that
sequestered within this citadel of desolation were no
living horses nor cattle, but very different and much
quieter prisoners. The Methodist cemetery there,
dates back, it is said, to the days of religious persecution,
to the days of Whitfield and Wesley, if not even
further.</p>

<p>Our fugitive from the society of those who regard
their minds as normally constituted, cast an excited
and recognizant eye upon this forlorn enclosure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
Plucking a handful of leaves from one of the ash-trees
and thrusting them into his pocket, some queer
legend&mdash;half-remembered in his agitated state&mdash;impelling
him to this quaint action, he left the roadway,
crossed the field, and pushing open the rusty
iron gate of the little burying-ground, burst hurriedly
in among its weather-stained memorials of the
dead.</p>

<p>Though not of any great height, the enclosing walls
of the place were sufficient to intensify by several
degrees the gathering shadows. Outside, in the open
field, one would have anticipated a clear hour of
twilight before the darkness fell; but here, among
the graves of these humble recalcitrants against
spiritual authority, it seemed as though the plunge
of the planet into its diurnal obscuring was likely to
be retarded for only a few brief moments.</p>

<p>James Andersen sat down upon a nameless mound,
and fixed his gaze upon the heap of stones referred
to by Mr. Quincunx. The evening was warm and
still, and though the sky yet retained much of its
lightness of colour, the invading darkness&mdash;like a
beast on padded feet&mdash;was felt as a palpable presence
moving slowly among the tombs.</p>

<p>The stone-carver began muttering in a low voice
scattered and incoherent repetitions of his conversation
with the potato-digger. But his voice suddenly
died away under a startling interruption. He became
aware that the heavy cemetery gate was being
pushed open from outside.</p>

<p>Such is the curious law regulating the action of
human nerves, and making them dependent upon
the mood of the mind to which they are attached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
that an event which to a normal consciousness is
fraught with ghostly terror, to a consciousness already
strained beyond the breaking point, appears as something
natural and ordinary. It is one of the privileges
of mania, that those thus afflicted should be
freed from the normal oppression of human terror.
A madman would take a ghost into his arms.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, the most normal nerves
would have suffered no shock from the figure that
presented itself in the entrance when the door was
fully opened. A young girl, pale and breathless,
rushed impulsively into the cemetery, and catching
sight of Andersen at once, hastened straight to him
across the grave-mounds.</p>

<p>“I was coming back from the village,” she gasped,
preventing him with a trembling pressure of her hand
from rising from his seat, and casting herself down
beside him, “and I met Mr. Clavering. He told me
you had gone off somewhere and I guessed at once
it was to Dead Man’s Lane. I said nothing to him,
but as soon as he had left me, I ran nearly all the
way to the cottage. The gentleman there told me
to follow you. He said it was on his conscience that
he had advised you to come up here. He said he
was just making up his mind to come on after you,
but he thought it was better for me to come. So
here I am! James&mdash;dear James&mdash;you are not really
ill are you? They frightened me, those two, by what
they said. They seemed to be afraid that you would
hurt yourself if you went off alone. But you wouldn’t
James dear, would you? You would think of me a
little?”</p>

<p>She knelt at his side and tenderly pushed back the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
hair from his brow. “Oh I love you so!” she murmured,
“I love you so! It would kill me if anything
dreadful happened to you.” She pressed his head
passionately against her breast, hardly conscious in
her emotion of the burning heat of his forehead as
it touched her skin.</p>

<p>“You will think of me a little!” she pleaded,
“you will take care of yourself for my sake, Jim?”</p>

<p>She held him thus, pressed tightly against her, for
several seconds, while her bosom rose and fell in
quick spasms of convulsive pity. She had torn off
her hat in her agitation, and flung it heedlessly down
at her feet, and a heavy tress of her thick auburn
hair&mdash;colourless now as the night itself&mdash;fell loosely
upon her bowed neck. The fading light from the
sky above them seemed to concentrate itself upon
the ivory pallor of her clasped fingers and the dead-white
glimmer of her impassioned face. She might
have risen out of one of the graves that surrounded
them, so ghostly in the gloom did her figure look.</p>

<p>The stone-carver freed himself at length, and took
her hands in his own. The shock of the girl’s emotion
had quieted his own fever. From the touch of
her flesh he seemed to have derived a new and rational
calm.</p>

<p>“Little Ninsy!” he whispered. “Little Ninsy! It
is not I, but you, who are ill. Have you been up,
and about, many days? I didn’t know it! I’ve had
troubles of my own.” He passed his hand across his
forehead. “I’ve had dreams, dreams and fancies!
I’m afraid I’ve made a fool of myself, and frightened
all sorts of people. I think I must have been
saying a lot of silly things today. My head feels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
still queer. It’s hurt me so much lately, my head!
And I’ve heard voices, voices that wouldn’t stop.”</p>

<p>“Oh James, my darling, my darling!” cried the girl,
in a great passion of relief. “I knew what they said
wasn’t true. I knew you would speak gently to me,
and be your old self. Love me, James! Love me as
you used to in the old days.”</p>

<p>She rose to her feet and pulled him up upon his.
Then with a passionate abandonment she flung her
arms round him and pressed him to her, clinging to
him with all her force and trembling as she clung.</p>

<p>James yielded to her emotion more spontaneously
than he had ever done in his life. Their lips met in
a long in-drawing kiss which seemed to merge their
separate identities, and blend them indissolubly
together. She clung to him as a bind-weed, with its
frail white flowers, might cling to a stalk of swaying
corn, and not unlike such an entwined stalk, he
swayed to and fro under the clinging of her limbs.
The passion which possessed her communicated
itself to him, and in a strange ecstasy of oblivion he
embraced her as desperately as her wild love could
wish.</p>

<p>From sheer exhaustion their lips parted at last,
and they sank down, side by side, upon the dew-drenched
grass, making the grave-mount their pillow.
Obscurely, through the clouded chamber of
his brain, passed the image of her poppy-scarlet
mouth burning against the whiteness of her skin.
All that he could now actually see of her face, in the
darkness, was its glimmering pallor, but the feeling
of her kiss remained and merged itself in this impression.
He lay on his back with closed eyes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
she bent over him as he lay, and began kissing him
again, as if her soul would never be satisfied. In the
intervals of her kisses, she pressed her fingers against
his forehead, and uttered incoherent and tender
whispers. It seemed to her as though, by the very
magnetism of her devotion, she <em>must</em> be able to restore
his shattered wits.</p>

<p>Nor did her efforts seem in vain. After a while
the stone-carver lifted himself up and looked round
him. He smiled affectionately at Ninsy and patted
her, almost playfully, upon the knee.</p>

<p>“You have done me good, child,” he said. “You
have done me more good than you know. I don’t
think I shall say any more silly things tonight.”</p>

<p>He stood up on his feet, heaved a deep, natural
sigh, and stretched himself, as one roused from a long
sleep.</p>

<p>“What have you managed to do to me, Ninsy?”
he asked. “I feel completely different. Those
voices in my head have stopped.” He turned tenderly
towards her. “I believe you’ve driven the evil
spirit out of me, child,” he said.</p>

<p>She flung her arms round him with a gasping cry.
“You do like me a little, Jim? Oh my darling, I love
you so much! I love you! I love you!” She clung
to him with frenzied passion, her breast convulsed
with sobs, and the salt tears mingling with her
kisses.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he held her body in his arms, he felt
a shuddering tremor run through her, from head to
foot. Her head fell back, helpless and heavy, and
her whole frame hung limp and passive upon his
arm. It almost seemed as though, in exorcising, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
the magnetic power of her love, the demon that
possessed him, she had broken her own heart.</p>

<p>Andersen was overwhelmed with alarm and remorse.
He laid her gently upon the ground, and chafed the
palms of her hands whispering her name and uttering
savage appeals to Providence. His appeals, however,
remained unanswered, and she lay deadly still, her
coils of dusky hair spread loose over the wet
grass.</p>

<p>He rose in mute dismay, and stared angrily round
the cemetery, as if demanding assistance from its
silent population. Then with a glance at her motionless
form, he ran quickly to the open gate and
shouted loudly for help. His voice echoed hollowly
through the walled enclosure, and a startled flutter
of wings rose from the distant fir-trees. Somewhere
down in the valley, a dog began to bark, but no
other answer to his repeated cry reached his ears.
He returned to the girl’s side.</p>

<p>Frantically he rent open her dress at the throat
and tore with trembling fingers at the laces of her
bodice. He pressed his hand against her heart. A
faint, scarcely discernible tremor under her soft
breast reassured him. She was not dead, then! He
had not killed her with his madness.</p>

<p>He bent down and made an effort to lift her in
his arms, but his limbs trembled beneath him and
his muscles collapsed helplessly. The reaction from
the tempest in his brain had left him weak as an
infant. In this wretched inability to do anything
to restore her he burst into a fit of piteous tears, and
struck his forehead with his clenched hand.</p>

<p>Once more he tried desperately to lift her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
once more, fragile as she was, the effort proved
hopelessly beyond his strength. Suddenly, out of
the darkness beyond the cemetery gate, he heard the
sound of voices.</p>

<p>He shouted as loudly as he could and then listened
intently, with beating heart. An answering shout
responded, in Luke’s well-known voice. A moment
or two later, and Luke himself, followed by Mr.
Quincunx, hurried into the cemetery.</p>

<p>Immediately after Ninsy’s departure the recluse
had been seized with uncontrollable remorse. Mixed
with his remorse was the disturbing consciousness that
since Ninsy knew he had advised Andersen to make
his way to Seven Ashes, the knowledge was ultimately
sure to reach the younger brother’s ears. Luke was
one of the few intimates Mr. Quincunx possessed in
Nevilton. The recluse held him in curious respect
as a formidable and effective man of the world. He
had an exaggerated notion of his power. He had
grown accustomed to his evening visits. He was
fond of him and a little afraid of him.</p>

<p>It was therefore an extremely disagreeable thought
to his mind, to conceive of Luke as turning upon
him with contempt and indignation. Thus impelled,
the perturbed solitary had summoned up all his
courage and gone boldly down into the village to
find the younger Andersen. He had met him at the
gate of Mr. Taxater’s house.</p>

<p>Left behind in the station field by James and his
pursuers, Luke had reverted for a while with the
conscious purpose of distracting his mind, to his old
preoccupation, and had spent the afternoon in a
manner eminently congenial, making love to two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
damsels at the same time, and parrying with evasive
urbanity their combined recriminations.</p>

<p>At the close of the afternoon, having chatted for
an hour with the station-master’s wife, and shared
their family tea, he had made his way according to
his promise, into Mr. Taxater’s book-lined study,
and there, closely closeted with the papal champion,
had smoothed out the final threads of the conspiracy
that was to betray Gladys and liberate Lacrima.</p>

<p>Luke had been informed by Mr. Quincunx of every
detail of James’ movements and of Ninsy’s appearance
on the scene. The recluse, as the reader may believe,
did not spare himself in any point. He even exaggerated
his fear of the agitated stone-carver, and as they
hastened together towards Seven Ashes, he narrated,
down to the smallest particular, the strange conversation
they had had in his potato-garden.</p>

<p>“Why do you suppose,” he enquired of Luke, as
they ascended the final slope of the hill, “he talked
so much of someone giving me money? Who, on
earth, is likely to give me money? People don’t as
a rule throw money about, like that, do they? And
if they did, I am the last person they would throw it
to. I am the sort of person that kind and good
people naturally hate. It’s because they know I
know the deep little vanities and cunning selfishness
in their blessed deeds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>
<p>“No one in this world really acts from pure motives.
We are all grasping after our own gain. We are all
pleased when other people come to grief, and sorry
when things go well with them. It’s human nature,
that’s what it is! Human nature is always vicious.
It was human nature in me that made me send your
brother up this hill, instead of taking him back to
the village. It was human nature in you that made
you curse me as you did, when I first told you.”</p>

<p>Luke did his best to draw Mr. Quincunx back from
these general considerations to his conversation with
James.</p>

<p>“What did you say,” he enquired, “when he asked
you about marrying Lacrima, supposing this imaginary
kind person were available? Did you tell him
you would do it?”</p>

<p>“You mean, was he really jealous?” replied the
other, with one of his goblin-like laughs.</p>

<p>“It was a strange question to ask,” pursued Luke.
“I can’t imagine how you answered it.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Mr. Quincunx, “we know very
well what he was driving at. He wanted to sound
me. Whatever may be wrong with him he was
clever enough to want to sound me. We are all like
that! We are all going about the world trying to
find out each other’s weakest points, with the idea
that it may be useful to us to know them, so as to
be able to stick knives into them when we want to.”</p>

<p>“It was certainly rather a strange question considering
that he is a bit attracted to Lacrima himself,”
remarked Luke. “I should think you were
very cautious how you answered.”</p>

<p>“Cautious?” replied Mr. Quincunx. “I don’t believe
in caution. Caution is a thing for well-to-do
people who have something to lose. I answered him
exactly as I would answer anyone. I said I should
be a fool not to agree. And so I should. Don’t you
think so, Andersen? I should be a fool not to marry,
under such circumstances?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>“It depends what your feelings are towards Lacrima,”
answered the wily stone-carver.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that, in that tone?” said the
recluse sharply. “You know very well what I feel
towards Lacrima. Everyone knows. She is the one
little streak of romance that the gods have allowed
to cross my path. She is my only girl-friend in
Nevilton.”</p>

<p>At that moment the two men reached Seven Ashes
and the sound of their voices was carried to the cemetery,
with the result already narrated.</p>

<p>It will be remarked as an interesting exception to
the voluble candour of Mr. Quincunx, that in his
conversation with Luke he avoided all mention of
Lacrima’s fatal contract with Mr. Romer. He had
indeed, on an earlier occasion, approached the outskirts
of this affair, in an indirect manner and with
much manœuvring. From what he had hinted then,
Luke had formed certain shrewd surmises, in the
direction of the truth, but of the precise facts he
remained totally ignorant.</p>

<p>The shout for help which interrupted this discussion
gave the two men a shock of complete surprise.
They were still more surprised, when on entering
the cemetery they found James standing over the
apparently lifeless form of Ninsy Lintot, her clothes
torn and her hair loose and dishevelled. Their astonishment
reached its climax when they noticed the
sane and rational way in which the stone-carver
addressed them. He was in a state of pitiful agitation,
but he was no longer mad.</p>

<p>By dint of their united efforts they carried the girl
across the field, and laid her down beneath the ash-trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
The fresher air of this more exposed spot
had an immediate effect upon her. She breathed
heavily, and her fingers, under the caress of James’
hands, lost their rigidity. Across her shadowy white
face a quiver passed, and her head moved a little.</p>

<p>“Ninsy! Ninsy, dear!” murmured Andersen as he
knelt by her side. By the light of the clear stars,
which now filled the sky with an almost tropical
splendour, the three men gazing anxiously at her
face saw her eyes slowly open and her lips part in
a tender recognitory smile.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” cried James, “You are better now,
Ninsy, aren’t you? Here is Luke and Mr. Quincunx.
They came to find us. They’ll help me to get you
safe home.”</p>

<p>The girl murmured some indistinct and broken
phrase. She smiled again, but a pathetic attempt
she made to lift her hand to her throat proved her
helpless weakness. Tenderly, as a mother might,
James anticipated her movement, and restored to as
natural order as he could her torn and ruffled
dress.</p>

<p>At that moment to the immense relief of the three
watchers the sound of cart-wheels became audible.
The vehicle proved to be a large empty wagon driven
by one of Mr. Goring’s men on the way back from
an outlying hamlet. They all knew the driver, who
pulled up at once at their appeal.</p>

<p>On an extemporized couch at the bottom of the
wagon, made of the men’s coats,&mdash;Mr. Quincunx
being the first to offer his,&mdash;they arranged the girl’s
passive form as comfortably as the rough vehicle
allowed. And then, keeping the horses at a walking-pace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
they proceeded along the lane towards Wild
Pine.</p>

<p>For some while, as he walked by the cart’s side,
his hand upon its well-worn edge, James experienced
extreme weariness and lassitude. His legs shook
under him and his heart palpitated. The demon
which had been driven out of him, had left him, it
seemed, like his biblical prototype, exhausted and
half-dead. By the time, however, that they reached
the corner, where Root-Thatch Lane descends to the
village, and Nevil’s Gully commences, the cool air
of the night and the slow monotonous movement
had restored a considerable portion of his strength.</p>

<p>None of the men, as they went along, had felt in
a mood for conversation. Luke had spent his time,
naming to himself, with his accustomed interest in
such phenomena, the various familiar constellations
which shone down upon them between the dark
boughs of the Scotch-firs.</p>

<p>The thoughts of Mr. Quincunx were confused and
strange. He had fallen into one of his self-condemnatory
moods, and like a solemn ghost moving by his
side, a grim projection of his inmost identity kept
rebuking and threatening him. As with most retired
persons, whose lives are passed in an uninterrupted
routine, the shock of any unusual or unforseen accident
fell upon him with a double weight.</p>

<p>He had been much more impressed by the wild
agitation of James, and by the sight of Ninsy’s unconscious
and prostrate figure, than anyone who
knew only the cynical side of him would have supposed
possible. The cynicism of Mr. Quincunx was
indeed strictly confined to philosophical conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
In practical life he was wont to encounter any sudden
or tragic occurrence with the unsophisticated sensitiveness
of a child. As with many other sages, whose
philosophical proclivities are rather instinctive than
rational, Mr. Quincunx was liable to curious lapses
into the most simple and superstitious misgivings.</p>

<p>The influence of their slow and mute advance,
under the majestic heavens, may have had something
to do with this reaction, but it is certain that
this other Mr. Quincunx&mdash;this shadowy companion
with no cabbage-leaf under his hat&mdash;pointed a most
accusing finger at him. Before they reached Nevil’s
Gully, the perturbed recluse had made up his mind
that, at all costs, he would intervene to prevent this
scandalous union of his friend with John Goring.
Contract or no contract, he must exert himself in
some definite and overt manner to stave off this
outrage.</p>

<p>To his startled conscience the sinister figure of
Mr. Romer seemed to extend itself, Colossus-like,
from the outstretched neck of Cygnus, the heavenly
Swan, to the low-hung brilliance of the “lord-star”
Jupiter, and accompanying this Satanic shadow across
his vision, was a horrible and most realistic image of
the frail Italian, struggling in vain against the brutal
advances of Mr. Goring. He seemed to see Lacrima,
lying helpless, as Ninsy had been lying, but with no
protecting forms grouped reassuringly around her.</p>

<p>The sense of the pitiful helplessness of these girlish
beings, thrust by an indifferent fate into the midst
of life’s brute forces, had pierced his conscience with
an indelible stab when first he had seen her prostrate
in the cemetery. For a vague transitory moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
he had wondered then, whether his sending her in
pursuit of a madman had resulted in a most lamentable
tragedy; and though Andersen’s manner had
quickly reassured him as it had simultaneously reassured
Luke, the original impression of the shock
remained.</p>

<p>At that moment, as he helped to lift Ninsy out of
the wagon, and carry her through the farm-yard to
her father’s cottage, the cynical recluse felt an almost
quixotic yearning to put himself to any inconvenience
and sacrifice any comfort, if only one such soft
feminine creature as he supported now in his arms,
might be spared the contact of gross and violating
hands.</p>

<p>James Andersen, as well as Mr. Quincunx, remained
silent during their return towards the village. In
vain Luke strove to lift off from them this oppression
of pensive and gentle melancholy. Neither his stray
bits of astronomical pedantry, nor his Rabelaisean
jests at the expense of a couple of rural amorists
they stumbled upon in the overshadowed descent,
proved arresting enough to break his companion’s
silence.</p>

<p>At the bottom of Root-Thatch Lane Mr. Quincunx
separated from the brothers. His way led directly
through the upper portion of the village to the Yeoborough
road, while that of the Andersens passed
between the priory and the church.</p>

<p>The clock in St. Catharine’s tower was striking
ten as the two brothers moved along under the
churchyard wall. With the departure of Mr. Quincunx
James seemed to recover his normal spirits.
This recovery was manifested in a way that rejoiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
the heart of Luke, so congruous was it with all their
old habits and associations; but to a stranger overhearing
the words, it would have seemed the reverse
of promising.</p>

<p>“Shall we take a glance at the grave?” the elder
brother suggested, leaning his elbows on the moss-grown
wall. Luke assented with alacrity, and the
ancient stones of the wall lending themselves easily
to such a proceeding, they both clambered over into
the place of tombs.</p>

<p>Thus within the space of forty-eight hours the
brothers Andersen had been together in no less than
three sepulchral enclosures. One might have supposed
that the same destiny that made of their
father a kind of modern Old Mortality&mdash;less pious, it
is true, than his prototype, but not less addicted to
invasions of the unprotesting dead&mdash;had made it
inevitable that the most critical moments of his sons’
lives should be passed in the presence of these mute
witnesses.</p>

<p>They crossed over to where the head-stone of
their parents’ grave rose, gigantic and imposing in
the clear star light, as much larger than the other
monuments as the beaver, into which Pau-Puk-Keewis
changed himself, was larger than the other
beavers. They sat down on a neighbouring mound
and contemplated in silence their father’s work. The
dark dome of the sky above them, strewn with
innumerable points of glittering light, attracted Luke
once more to his old astronomical speculations.</p>

<p>“I have an idea,” he said, “that there is more in
the influence of these constellations than even the
astrologers have guessed. Their method claims to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
a scientific one, mathematical in the exactness of its
inferences. My feeling about the matter is, that
there is something much more arbitrary, much more
living and wayward, in the manner in which they
work their will upon us. I said ‘constellations,’
but I don’t believe, as a matter of fact, that it is
from them at all that the influences come. The
natural and obvious thing is that the <em>planets</em> should
affect us, and affect us very much in the same way
as we affect one another. The ancient races recognized
this difference. The fixed stars are named
after animals, or inanimate objects, or after powerful,
but not more than human, heroes. The planets
are all named from immortal gods, and it is as gods,&mdash;as
wilful and arbitrary gods&mdash;that they influence
our destinies.”</p>

<p>James Andersen surveyed the large and brilliant
star which at that moment hung, like an enormous
glow-worm, against the southern slope of Nevilton
Mount.</p>

<p>“Some extremely evil planet must have been very
active during these last weeks with Lacrima and with
me,” he remarked. “Don’t get alarmed, my dear,”
he added, noticing the look of apprehension which
his brother turned upon him. “I shan’t worry you
with any more silly talk. Those voices in my head
have quite ceased. But that does not help Lacrima.”
He laughed a sad little laugh.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he added, “no one can help her in
this devilish situation,&mdash;except that queer fellow
who’s just left us. I would let him step over my
dead body, if he would only carry her off and fool
them all!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>Luke’s mind plunged into a difficult problem. His
brother’s wits were certainly restored, and he seemed
calm and clear-headed. But was he clear-headed
enough to learn the details of the curious little conspiracy
which Mr. Taxater’s diplomatic brain had
evolved? How would this somewhat ambiguous
transaction strike so romantic a nature as his?</p>

<p>Luke hesitated and pondered, the tall dark tower
of St. Catharine’s Church affording him but scant
inspiration, as it rose above them into the starlit
sky. Should he tell him or should he keep the matter
to himself, and enter into some new pretended scheme
with his brother, to occupy his mind and distract it,
for the time being?</p>

<p>So long did he remain silent, pondering this question,
that James, observing his absorbed state and
concluding that his subtle intelligence was occupied
in devising some way out of their imbroglio, gave
up all thought of receiving an answer, and moving
to a less dew-drenched resting-place, leaned his head
against an upright monument and closed his eyes.
The feeling that his admired brother was taking
Lacrima’s plight so seriously in hand filled him with
a reassuring calm, and he had not long remained in
his new position before his exhausted senses found
relief in sleep.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Luke weighed in his mind every
conceivable aspect of the question at stake. Less
grave and assured than the metaphysical Mr. Taxater
in this matter of striking at evil persons with evil
weapons, Luke was not a whit less unscrupulous.</p>

<p>No Quincunx-like visitings of compunction had followed,
with him, their rescue of Ninsy. If the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
at Seven Ashes had printed any impression at all
upon his volatile mind, it was merely a vague and
agreeable sense of how beautiful the girl’s dead-white
skin had looked, contrasted with the disturbed
masses of her dusky hair. Beyond this, except for a
pleasant memory of how lightly and softly she had
lain upon his arm, as he helped to carry her across
the Wild Pine barton, the occurrence had left him
unaffected.</p>

<p>His conscience did not trouble him in the smallest
degree with regard to Gladys. According to Luke’s
philosophy of life, things in this world resolved
themselves into a reckless hand-to-hand struggle between
opposing personalities, every one of them seeking,
with all the faculties at his disposal, to get the
better of the others. It was absurd to stop and
consider such illusive impediments as sentiment or
honour, when the great, casual, indifferent universe
which surrounds us knows nothing of these things!</p>

<p>Out of the depths of this chaotic universe he, Luke
Andersen, had been flung. It must be his first concern
to sweep aside, as irrelevant and meaningless,
any mere human fancies, ill-based and adventitious,
upon which his free foot might stumble. To strike
craftily and boldly in defence of the person he loved
best in the world seemed to him not only natural but
commendable. How should he be content to indulge
in vague sentimental shilly-shallying, when the whole
happiness of his beloved Daddy James was at stake?</p>

<p>The difference between Luke’s attitude to their
mutual conspiracy, and that of Mr. Taxater, lay in
the fact that to the latter the whole event was
merely part of an elaborate, deeply-involved campaign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
whose ramifications extended indefinitely on
every side; while to the former the affair was only one
of those innumerable chaotic struggles that a whimsical
world delighted to evoke.</p>

<p>An inquisitive observer might have wondered what
purpose Mr. Taxater had in mixing himself up in
the affair at all. This question of his fellow-conspirator’s
motive crossed, as a matter of fact, Luke’s
own mind, as his gaze wandered negligently from the
Greater to the Lesser Bear, and from Orion to the
Pleiades. He came to the characteristic conclusion
that it was no quixotic impulse that had impelled
this excellent man, but a completely conscious and
definite desire&mdash;the desire to add yet one more wanderer
to his list of converts to the Faith.</p>

<p>Lacrima was an Italian and a Catholic. United to
Mr. Quincunx, might she not easily win over that
dreamy infidel to the religion of her fathers? Luke
smiled to himself as he thought how little the papal
champion could have known the real character of
the solitary of Dead Man’s Lane. Sooner might the
sea at Weymouth flow inland, and wash with its
waves the foot of Leo’s Hill, than this ingrained
mystic bow his head under the yoke of dogmatic
truth!</p>

<p>After long cogitation with himself, Luke came to
the conclusion that it would be wiser, on the whole,
to say nothing to his brother of his plan to work out
Lacrima’s release by means of her cousin’s betrayal.
Having arrived at this conclusion he rose and stretched
himself, and glanced at the sleeping James.</p>

<p>The night was warm and windless, but Luke began
to feel anxious lest the cold touch of the stone, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
which his brother rested, should strike a chill into
his blood. At the same time he was extremely loth
to disturb so placid and wholesome a slumber. He
laid his hand upon the portentous symbol of mortality
which crowned so aggressively his parents’
monument, and looked round him. His vigil had
already been interrupted more than once by the
voices of late revellers leaving the Goat and Boy.
Such voices still recurred, at intermittent moments,
followed by stumbling drunken footsteps, but in the
intervals the silence only fell the deeper.</p>

<p>Suddenly he observed, or fancied he observed, the
aspect of a figure extremely familiar to him, standing
patiently outside the inn door. He hurried across
the churchyard and looked over the wall. No, he
had not been mistaken. There, running her hands
idly through the leaves of the great wistaria which
clung to the side of the house, stood his little friend
Phyllis. She had evidently been sent by her mother,&mdash;as
younger maids than she were often sent&mdash;to
assist, upon their homeward journey, the unsteady
steps of Bill Santon the carter.</p>

<p>Luke turned and glanced at his brother. He could
distinguish his motionless form, lying as still as ever,
beyond the dark shape of his father’s formidable
tombstone. There was no need to disturb him yet.
The morrow was Sunday, and they could therefore
be as late as they pleased.</p>

<p>He called softly to the patient watcher. She
started violently at hearing his voice, and turning
round, peered into the darkness. By degrees she
made out his form, and waved her hand to him.</p>

<p>He beckoned her to approach. She shook her head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
and indicated by a gesture that she was expecting
the appearance of her father. Once more he called
her, making what seemed to her, in the obscurity,
a sign that he had something important to communicate.
Curiosity overcame piety in the heart of the
daughter of Bill Santon and she ran across the road.</p>

<p>“Why, you silly thing!” whispered the crafty Luke,
“your father’s been gone this half hour! He went a
bit of the way home with Sam Lintot. Old Sam will
find a nice little surprise waiting for him when he
gets back. I reckon he’ll send your father home-along
sharp enough.”</p>

<p>It was Luke’s habit, in conversation with the villagers,
to drop lightly into many of their provincial
phrases, though both he and his brother used, thanks
to their mother’s training, as good English as any of
the gentlefolk of Nevilton.</p>

<p>The influence of association in the matter of
language might have afforded endless interesting
matter to the student of words, supposing such a
one had been able to overhear the conversations of
these brothers with their various acquaintances. Poor
Ninsy, for instance, fell naturally into the local dialect
when she talked to James in her own house; and assumed,
with equal facility, her loved one’s more
colourless manner of speech, when addressing him on
ground less familiar to her.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the universal spread of board-school
education in that corner of the country had
begun to sap the foundations of the old local peculiarities.
Where these survived, in the younger generation,
they survived side by side with the newer tricks
of speech. The Andersens’ girl-friends were, all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
them, in reality, expert bilinguists. They spoke
the King’s English, and they spoke the Nevilton
English, with equal ease, if with unequal expressiveness.</p>

<p>The shrewd fillip to her curiosity, which Luke’s
reference to Lintot’s home-coming had given, allured
Phyllis into accepting without protest his audacious
invention about her father. The probability of such
an occurrence seemed sealed with certainty, when
turning, at a sign from her friend, she saw, against
the lighted window the burly form of the landlord
engaged in closing his shutters. It was not the custom,
as Phyllis well knew, of this methodical dispenser of
Dionysian joys to “shutter up house,” as he called
it, until every guest had departed. How could she
guess&mdash;little deluded maid!&mdash;that, stretched upon
the floor in the front parlor, stared at by the landlord’s
three small sons, was the comatose body of
her worthy parent breathing like one of Mr. Goring’s
pigs?</p>

<p>“Tain’t no good my waiting here then,” she whispered.
“What do ’ee mean by Sam Lintot’s being
surprised-like? Be Ninsy taken with her heart
again?”</p>

<p>“Let me help you over here,” answered the stone-carver,
“that Priory wench was talking, just now,
just across yon wall. She’ll be hearing what we say
if we don’t move on a bit.”</p>

<p>“Us don’t mind what a maid like her do hear, do
us, Luke dear?” whispered the girl in answer. “Give
me a kiss, sonny, and let me be getting home-along!”</p>

<p>She stood on tiptoe and raised her hands over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
top of the wall. Luke seized her wrists, and retained
them in a vicious clutch.</p>

<p>“Put your foot into one of those holes,” he said,
“and we’ll soon have you across.”</p>

<p>Unwilling to risk a struggle in such a spot, and not
really at all disinclined for an adventure, the girl
obeyed him, and after being hoisted up upon the
wall, was lifted quickly down on the other side, and
enclosed in Luke’s gratified arms. The amorous
stone-carver remembered long afterwards the peculiar
thrill of almost chaste pleasure which the first touch
of her cold cheeks gave him, as she yielded to his
embrace.</p>

<p>“<em>Is</em> Nin Lintot bad again?” she enquired, drawing
herself away at last.</p>

<p>Luke nodded. “You won’t see her about, this
week&mdash;or next week&mdash;or the week after,” he said.
“She’s pretty far gone, this time, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>Phyllis rendered to her acquaintance’s misfortune
the tribute of a conventional murmur.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s go and look at where they be burying
Jimmy Pringle!” she suddenly whispered, in an awe-struck,
excited tone.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Luke, “you don’t mean to say he’s
dead,&mdash;the old man?”</p>

<p>“Where’s ’t been to, then, these last days?” she
enquired. “He died yesterday morning and they
be going to bury him on Monday. ’Twill be a monstrous
large funeral. Can’t be but you’ve heard tell
of Jimmy’s being done for.” She added, in an amazed
and bewildered tone.</p>

<p>“I’ve been very busy this last week,” said Luke.</p>

<p>“You didn’t seem very busy this afternoon, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
you were with Annie and me up at station-field,”
she exclaimed, with a mischievous little laugh. Then
in a changed voice, “Let’s go and see where they’re
going to put him. It’s somewhere over there, under
South Wall.”</p>

<p>They moved cautiously hand in hand between the
dark grassy mounds, the heavy dew soaking their
shoes.</p>

<p>Suddenly Phyllis stopped, her fingers tightening,
and a delicious thrill of excitement quivering through
her. “There it is. Look!” she whispered.</p>

<p>They advanced a step or two, and found themselves
confronted by a gloomy oblong hole, and an
ugly heap of ejected earth.</p>

<p>“Oh, how awful it do look, doesn’t it, Luke darling?”
she murmured, clinging closely to him.</p>

<p>He put his arm round the girl’s waist, and together,
under the vast dome of the starlit sky, the two
warm-blooded youthful creatures contemplated the
resting-place of the generations.</p>

<p>“It’s queer to think,” remarked Luke pensively,
“that just as we stand looking on this, so, when
we’re dead, other people will stand over our graves,
and we know nothing and care nothing!”</p>

<p>“They dug this out this morning,” said Phyllis,
more concerned with the immediate drama than with
general meditations of mortality. “Old Ben Fursling’s
son did it, and my father helped him in his dinner-hour.
They said another hot day like this would
make the earth too hard.”</p>

<p>Luke moved forward, stepping cautiously over the
dark upturned soil. He paused at the extreme edge
of the gaping recess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’ll you give me,” he remarked turning to
his companion, “if I climb down into it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk like that, Luke,” protested the girl.
“’Tisn’t lucky to say them things. I wouldn’t give
you nothing. I’d run straight away and leave
you.”</p>

<p>The young man knelt down at the edge of the
hole, and with the elegant cane he had carried in his
hand all that afternoon, fumbled profanely in its
dusky depths. Suddenly, to the girl’s absolute horror,
he scrambled round, and deliberately let himself
down into the pit. She breathed a sigh of unutterable
relief, when she observed his head and shoulders
still above the level of the ground.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he whispered, “they’ve left it
half-finished. I suppose they’ll do the rest on
Monday.”</p>

<p>“Please get out of it, Luke,” the girl pleaded.
“I don’t like to see you there. It make me think
you’re standing on Jimmy Pringle.”</p>

<p>Luke obeyed her and emerged from the earth
almost as rapidly as he had descended.</p>

<p>When he was once more by her side, Phyllis gave
a little half-deliberate shudder of exquisite terror.
“Fancy,” she whispered, clinging tightly to him, “if
you was to drag me to that hole, and put me down
there! I think I should die of fright.”</p>

<p>This conscious playing with her own girlish fears
was a very interesting characteristic in Phyllis
Santon. Luke had recognized something of the sort
in her before, and now he wondered vaguely, as he
glanced from the obscurity of Nevilton Churchyard
to the brilliant galaxy of luminous splendour surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
the constellation Pegasus, whether she really
wanted him to take her at her word.</p>

<p>His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of
voices at the inn-door. They both held their breath,
listening intently.</p>

<p>“There’s father!” murmured the girl. “He must
have come back from Lintot’s and be trying to get
into the public again! Come and help me over the
wall, Luke darling. Only don’t let anybody see us.”</p>

<p>As they hurried across the enclosure, Phyllis whispered
in his ears a remark that seemed to him either
curiously irrelevant, or inspired in an occult manner
by psychic telepathy. She had lately refrained from
any reference to Lacrima. The Italian’s friendliness
to her under the Hullaway elms had made her reticent
upon this subject. On this occasion, however,
though quite ignorant of James’ presence in the
churchyard, she suddenly felt compelled to say to
Luke, in an intensely serious voice:</p>

<p>“If some of you clever ones don’t stop that marriage
of Master Goring, there’ll be some more holes
dug in this place! There be some things what them
above never will allow.”</p>

<p>He helped her over the wall, and watched her overtake
her staggering parent, who had already reeled
some distance down the road. Then he returned to
his brother and roused him from his sleep. James
was sulky and irritable at being so brusquely restored
to consciousness, but the temperature of his mind
appeared as normal and natural as ever.</p>

<p>They quitted the place without further conversation,
and strode off in silence up the village street.
The perpendicular slabs of the crowded head stones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
and the yet more numerous mounds that had neither
name nor memory, resumed their taciturn and lonely
watch.</p>

<p>To no human eyes could be made visible the poor
thin shade that was once Jimmy Pringle, as it swept,
bat-like, backwards and forwards, across the dew-drenched
grass. But the shade itself, endowed with
more perception than had been permitted to it while
imprisoned in the “muddy vesture” of our flesh
and blood, became aware, in its troubled flight, of
a singular spiritual occurrence.</p>

<p>Rising from the base of that skull-crowned monument,
two strange and mournful phantoms flitted
waveringly, like huge ghost-moths, along the protruding
edge of the church-roof. Two desolate and
querulous voices, like the voices of conflicting winds
through the reeds of some forlorn salt-marsh, quivered
across the listening fields.</p>

<p>“It is strong and unconquered&mdash;the great heart
of my Hill,” one voice wailed out. “It draws them.
It drives them. The earth is with it; the planets are
for it, and all their enchantments cannot prevail
against it!”</p>

<p>“The leaves may fall and the trees decay,” moaned
the second voice, “but where the sap has once
flowed, Love must triumph.”</p>

<p>The fluttering shadow of Jimmy Pringle fled in
terror from these strange sounds, and took refuge
among the owls in the great sycamore of the Priory
meadow. A falling meteorite swept downwards from
the upper spaces of the sky and lost itself behind
the Wild Pine ridge.</p>

<p>“Strength and cunning,” the first voice wailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
forth again, “alone possess their heart’s desire. All
else is vain and empty.”</p>

<p>“Love and Sacrifice,” retorted the other, “outlast
all victories. Beyond the circle of life they rule the
darkness, and death is dust beneath their feet.”</p>

<p>Crouched on a branch of his protecting sycamore,
the thin wraith of Jimmy Pringle trembled and shook
like an aspen-leaf. A dumb surprise possessed the
poor transmuted thing to find itself even less assured
of palpable and familiar salvation, than when, after
drinking cider at the Boar’s Head in Athelston, he
had dreamed dreams at Captain Whiffley’s gate.</p>

<p>“The Sun is lord and god of the earth,” wailed
the first voice once more. “The Sun alone is master
in the end. Lust and Power go forth with him, and
all flesh obeys his command.”</p>

<p>“The Moon draws more than the tides,” answered
the second voice. “In the places of silence where
Love waits, only the Moon can pass; and only the
Moon can hear the voice of the watchers.”</p>

<p>From the red planet, high up against the church-tower,
to the silver planet low down among the
shadowy trees, the starlit spaces listened mutely to
these antiphonal invocations. Only the distant expanse
of the Milky Way, too remote in its translunar
gulfs to heed these planetary conflicts, shimmered
haughtily down upon the Wood and Stone of Nevilton&mdash;impassive,
indifferent, unconcerned.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller">VOX POPULI</span></h2>

<p>James Andersen’s mental state did not fall
away from the restored equilibrium into which
the unexpected intervention of Ninsy Lintot had
magnetized and medicined him. He went about his
work as usual, gloomier and more taciturn, perhaps,
than before, but otherwise with no deviation from
his normal condition.</p>

<p>Luke noticed that he avoided all mention of Lacrima,
and, as far as the younger brother knew, made
no effort to see her. Luke himself received, two
days after the incident in the Methodist cemetery, a
somewhat enigmatic letter from Mr. Taxater. This
letter bore a London post-mark and informed the
stone-carver that after a careful consideration of
the whole matter, and an interview with Lacrima, the
writer had come to the conclusion that no good purpose
would be served by carrying their plan into execution.
Mr. Taxater had, accordingly, so the missive
declared, destroyed the incriminating document which
he had induced Luke to sign, and had relinquished
all thought of an interview with Mr. Dangelis.</p>

<p>The letter concluded by congratulating Luke on his
brother’s recovery&mdash;of which, it appeared, the diplomatist
had been informed by the omniscient Mrs.
Wotnot&mdash;and assuring him that if ever, in any way,
he, the writer, could be of service to either of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
two brothers, they could count on his unfailing regard.
An obscure post-script, added in pencil in a
very minute and delicate hand, indicated that the
interview with Lacrima, referred to above, had confirmed
the theologian in a suspicion that hitherto
he had scrupulously concealed, namely, that their
concern with regard to the Italian’s position was less
called for than appearances had led them to suppose.</p>

<p>After reading and weighing this last intimation,
before he tore up the letter into small fragments,
the cynical Luke came to the conclusion that the
devoted champion of the papacy had found out that
his co-religionist had fallen from grace; in other words,
that Lacrima Traffio was no longer a Catholic. It
could hardly be expected, the astute youth argued,
that Mr. Taxater should throw himself into a difficult
and troublesome intrigue in order that an apostate
from the inviolable Faith, once for all delivered
to the Saints, should escape what might reasonably
be regarded as a punishment for her apostacy.</p>

<p>The theologian’s post-script appeared to hint that
the girl was not, after all, so very unwilling, in this
matter of her approaching marriage. Luke, in so far
as he gave such an aspect of the affair any particular
thought, discounted this plausible suggestion as a
mere conscience-quieting salve, introduced by the
writer to smooth over the true cause of his reaction.</p>

<p>For his own part it had been always of James and
not of Lacrima he had thought, and since James had
now been restored to his normal state, the question
of the Italian’s moods and feelings affected him very
little. He was still prepared to discuss with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
brother any new chance of intervention that might
offer itself at the last moment. He desired James’
peace of mind before everything else, but in his
heart of hearts he had considerable doubt whether
the mood of self-effacing magnanimity which had
led his brother to contemplate Lacrima’s elopement
with Mr. Quincunx, would long survive the return
of his more normal temper. Were he in James’
position, he told himself grimly, he should have much
preferred that the girl should marry a man she hated
rather than one she loved, as in such a case the field
would be left more open for any future “rapprochement.”</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the luckless Pariah, by
the simple accident of her inability to hold fast to
her religion, lost at the critical moment in her life
the support of the one friendly power, that seemed
capable, in that confusion of opposed forces, of bringing
to her aid temporal as well as spiritual, pressure.
She was indeed a prisoner by the waters of Babylon,
but her forgetfulness of Sion had cut her off from the
assistance of the armies of the Lord.</p>

<p>The days passed on rapidly now, over the heads of
the various persons involved in our narrative. For
James and Lacrima, and in a measure for Mr. Quincunx,
too,&mdash;since it must be confessed that the
shock of Ninsy’s collapse had not resulted in any
permanent tightening of the recluse’s moral fibre,&mdash;they
passed with that treacherous and oblivious
smoothness which dangerous waters are only too
apt to wear, when on the very verge of the cataract.</p>

<p>In the stir and excitement of the great political
struggle which now swept furiously from one end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
the country to the other, the personal fortunes of a
group of tragically involved individuals, in a small
Somersetshire village, seemed to lose, for all except
those most immediately concerned, every sort of
emphasis and interest.</p>

<p>The polling day at last arrived, and a considerable
proportion of the inhabitants of Nevilton, both men
and women, found themselves, as the end of the
fatal hours approached, wedged and hustled, in a
state of distressing and exhausted suspense, in the
densely crowded High Street in front of the Yeoborough
Town Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Clavering himself was there, and in no very
amiable temper. Perverse destiny had caused him
to be helplessly surrounded by a noisy high-spirited
crew of Yeoborough factory-girls, to whom the event
in progress was chiefly interesting, in so far as it
afforded them an opportunity to indulge in uproarious
chaff and to throw insulting or amorous challenges
to various dandified youths of their acquaintance,
whom they caught sight of in the confusion. Mr.
Clavering’s ill-temper reached its climax when he
became aware that a good deal of the free and indiscreet
badinage of his companions was addressed to
none other than his troublesome parishioner, Luke
Andersen, whose curly head, surmounted by an
aggressively new straw hat, made itself visible not
far off.</p>

<p>The mood of the vicar of Nevilton during the last
few weeks had been one of accumulative annoyance.
Everything had gone wrong with him, and it was
only by an immense effort of his will that he had
succeeded in getting through his ordinary pastoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
labour, without betraying the unsettled state of his
mind and soul.</p>

<p>He could not, do what he might, get Gladys out
of his thoughts for one single hour of the day. She
had been especially soft and caressing, of late, in
her manner towards him. More submissive than of
old to his spiritual admonitions, she had dropped her
light and teasing ways, and had assumed, in her
recent lessons with him, an air of pliable wistfulness,
composed of long, timidly interrupted glances from
her languid blue eyes, and little low-voiced murmurs
of assent from her sweetly-parted lips.</p>

<p>It was in vain that the poor priest struggled against
this obsession. The girl was as merciless as she was
subtle in the devices she employed to make sure of
her hold upon him. She would lead him on, by hesitating
and innocent questions, to expound some difficult
matter of faith; and then, just as he was launched
out upon a high, pure stream of mystical interpretation,
she would bring his thoughts back to herself
and her deadly beauty, by some irresistible feminine
trick, which reduced all his noble speculations to so
much empty air.</p>

<p>Ever since that night when he had trembled so
helplessly under the touch of her soft fingers beneath
the cedars of the South Drive, she had sought opportunities
for evoking similar situations. She would
prolong the clasp of her hand when they bade one
another good night, knowing well how this apparently
natural and unconscious act would recur in throbs
of adder’s poison through the priest’s veins, long after
the sun had set behind St. Catharine’s tower.</p>

<p>She loved sometimes to tantalize and trouble him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
by relating incidents which brought herself and her
American fiancé into close association in his mind.
She would wistfully confide to him, for example,
how sometimes she grew weary of love-making,
begging him to tell her whether, after all, she were
wise in risking the adventure of marriage.</p>

<p>By these arts, and others that it were tedious to
enumerate, the girl gradually reduced the unfortunate
clergyman to a condition of abject slavery. The
worst of it was that, though his release from her
constant presence was rapidly approaching&mdash;with the
near date of the ceremonies for which he was preparing
her&mdash;instead of being able to rejoice in this,
he found himself dreading it with every nerve of his
harassed senses.</p>

<p>Clavering had felt himself compelled, on more than
one occasion, to allude to the project of Lacrima’s
marriage, but his knowledge of the Italian’s character
was so slight that Gladys had little difficulty in making
him believe, or at least persuade himself he
believed, that no undue pressure was being put upon
her.</p>

<p>It was of Lacrima that he suddenly found himself
thinking as, hustled and squeezed between two
obstreperous factory-girls, he watched the serene
and self-possessed Luke enjoying with detached
amusement the vivid confusion round him. The
fantastic idea came into his head, that in some sort
of way Luke was responsible for those sinister rumours
regarding the Italian’s position in Nevilton,
which had thrust themselves upon his ears as he
moved to and fro among the villagers.</p>

<p>He had learnt of the elder Andersen’s recovery from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
Mrs. Fringe, but even that wise lady had not been
able to associate this event with the serious illness
of Ninsy Lintot, to whose bed-side the young clergyman
had been summoned more than once during the
last week.</p>

<p>Clavering felt an impulse of unmitigated hatred
for the equable stone-carver as he watched him bandying
jests with this or the other person in the crowd,
and yet so obviously holding himself apart from it
all, and regarding the whole scene as if it only existed
for his amusement.</p>

<p>A sudden rush of some extreme partisans of the
popular cause, making a furious attempt to over-power
the persistent taunts of a group of young
farmers who stood above them on a raised portion
of the pavement, drove a wedge of struggling humanity
into the midst of the crowd who surrounded
the irritable priest. Clavering was pushed, in spite
of his efforts to extricate himself, nearer and nearer
to his detested rival, and at last, in the most grotesque
and annoying manner possible, he found himself
driven point-blank into the stone-carver’s very
arms. Luke smiled, with what seemed to the heated
and flustered priest the last limit of deliberate impertinence.</p>

<p>But there was no help for it. Clavering was
forced to accept his proffered hand, and return, with
a measure of courtesy, his nonchalant greeting.
Squeezed close together&mdash;for the crowd had concentrated
itself now into an immoveable mass&mdash;the fortunate
and the unfortunate lover of Gladys Romer
listened, side by side, to the deafening shouts, which,
first from one party and then from the other, heralded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
the appearance of the opposing candidates upon the
balcony above.</p>

<p>“I really hardly know,” said Luke, in a loud whisper,
“which side you are on. I suppose on the Conservative?
These radicals are all Nonconformists,
and only waiting for a chance of pulling the Church
down.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” retorted the priest raising his voice
so as to contend against the hubbub about them.
“I happen to be a radical myself. My own hope is
that the Church <em>will</em> be pulled down. The Church
I believe in cannot be touched. Its foundations are
too deep.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Romer and the Empire!” roared
a voice behind them.</p>

<p>“Wone and the People! Wone and the working-man!”
vociferated another.</p>

<p>“You’ll be holding your confirmation soon, I
understand,” murmured Luke in his companion’s ear,
as a swaying movement in the crowd squeezed them
even more closely together.</p>

<p>Hugh Clavering realized for the first time in his
life what murderers feel the second before they strike
their blow. He could have willingly planted his
heel at that moment upon the stone-carver’s face.
Surely the man was intentionally provoking him. He
must know&mdash;he could not help knowing&mdash;the agitation
in his nerves.</p>

<p>“Romer and Order! Romer and Sound Finance!”
roared one portion of the mob.</p>

<p>“Wone and Liberty! Wone and Justice!” yelled
the opposing section.</p>

<p>“I love a scene like this,” whispered Luke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
“Doesn’t it make you beautifully aware of the contemptible
littleness of the human race?”</p>

<p>“I am not only a radical,” retorted Clavering,
“but I happen also to be a human being, and one who
can’t take so airy a view of an occasion of this kind.
The enthusiasm of these people doesn’t at all amuse
me. I sympathize with it.”</p>

<p>The stone-carver was not abashed by this rebuke.
“A matter of taste,” he said, “a matter of taste.”
Then, freeing his arm which had got uncomfortably
wedged against his side, and pushing back his hat,
“I love to associate these outbursts of popular feeling
with the movements of the planets. Tonight,
you know, one ought to be able to see&mdash;”</p>

<p>Clavering could no longer contain himself. “Damn
your planets!” he cried, in a tone so loud, that an
old lady in their neighbourhood ejaculated, “Hush!
hush!” and looked round indignantly.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” muttered the priest, a little
ashamed. “What I mean is, I am most seriously
concerned about this contest. I pray devoutly Wone
will win. It’ll be a genuine triumph for the working
classes if he does.”</p>

<p>“Romer and the Empire!” interpolated the thunderous
voice behind them.</p>

<p>“I don’t care much for the man himself,” he went
on, “but this thing goes beyond personalities.”</p>

<p>“I’m all for Romer myself,” said Luke. “I have
the best of reasons for being grateful to him, though
he is my employer.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? What reasons?” cried
Clavering sharply, once more beginning to feel the
most unchristian hatred for this urbane youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure I needn’t tell you that, sir,” responded
Luke; “I’m sure you know well enough how much I
admire our Nevilton beauty.”</p>

<p>Gladys’ unhappy lover choked with rage. He had
never in his life loathed anything so much as he
loathed the way Luke’s yellow curls grew on his
forehead. His fingers clutched convulsively the palms
of his hands. He would like to have seized that
crop of hair and beaten the man’s head against the
pavement.</p>

<p>“I think it’s abominable,” he cried, “this forcing
of Miss Traffio to marry Goring. For a very little,
I’d write to the bishop about it and refuse to marry
them.”</p>

<p>The causes that led to this unexpected and irrelevant
outburst were of profound subtlety. Clavering
forgot, in his desire to make his rival responsible for
every tragedy in the place, that he had himself
resolved to discount, as mere village gossip, all the
dark rumours he had heard. The blind anger which
plunged him into this particular outcry, sprang, in
reality, from the bitterness of his own conscience-stricken
misgivings.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will,” remarked Luke, lowering
his voice to a whisper, though the uproar about them
rendered such a precaution quite unnecessary. “It
is not as a rule a good thing to interfere in these
matters. Miss Gladys has told me herself that the
whole thing is an invention of Romer’s enemies,
probably of this fellow Wone.”</p>

<p>“She’s told me the same story,” burst out the
priest, “but how am I to believe her?”</p>

<p>A person unacquainted with the labyrinthine convolutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
of the human mind would have been staggered
at hearing the infatuated slave thus betray
his suspicion of his enchantress, and to his own
rival; but the man’s long-troubled conscience, driven
by blind anger, rendered him almost beside himself.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” said Luke, “I think
neither you nor I have anything to do with this
affair. You might as well agitate yourself about
Miss Romer’s marriage with Dangelis! Girls must
manage these little problems for themselves. After
all, it doesn’t really matter much, one way or the
other. What they want, is to be married. The
person they choose is quite a secondary thing. We
have to learn to regard all these little incidents as
of but small importance, my good sir, as our world
sweeps round the sun!”</p>

<p>“The sun&mdash;the sun!” cried Clavering, with difficulty
restraining himself. “What has the sun to
do with it? You are too fond of bringing in your
suns and your planets, Andersen. This trick of
yours of shelving the difficulties of life, by pretending
you’re somehow superior to them all, is a habit I
advise you to give up! It’s cheap. It’s vulgar.
It grows tiresome after a time.”</p>

<p>Luke’s only reply to this was a sweet smile; and
the two were wedged so closely together that the
priest was compelled to notice the abnormal whiteness
and regularity of the young man’s teeth.</p>

<p>“I confess to you,” continued Luke, with an air
of unruffled detachment, as if they had been discussing
the tint of a flower or the marks upon a
butterfly’s wing, “I have often wondered what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
relations really are between Mr. Romer and Miss
Traffio; but that is the sort of question which, as
Sir Thomas Browne would say, lends itself to a
wide solution.”</p>

<p>“Romer and Prosperity!” “Wone and Justice!”
yelled the opposing factions.</p>

<p>“Our pretty Gladys’ dear parent,” continued the
incorrigible youth, completely disregarding the fact
that his companion, speechless with indignation, was
desperately endeavouring to extricate himself from
the press, “seems born under a particularly lucky star.
I notice that every attempt which people make to
thwart him comes to nothing. That’s what I admire
about him: he seems to move forward to his end
like an inexorable fate.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish!” ejaculated the priest, turning his
angry face once more towards his provoking rival.
“Fiddlesticks and rubbish! The man is a man, like
the rest of us. I only pray Heaven he’s going to
lose this election!”</p>

<p>“Under a lucky star,” reiterated the stone-carver.
“I wish I knew,” he added pensively, “what his star
is. Probably Jupiter!”</p>

<p>“Wone and Liberty!” “Wone and the Rights of
the People!” roared the crowd.</p>

<p>“Wone and God’s Vengeance!” answered, in an
indescribably bitter tone, a new and different voice.
Luke pressed his companion’s arm.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” he whispered eagerly.
“That’s Philip. Who would have thought he’d have
been here? He’s an anarchist, you know.”</p>

<p>Clavering, who was taller than his companion,
caught sight of the candidate’s son. Philip’s countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
was livid with excitement, and his arms were
raised as if actually invoking the Heavens.</p>

<p>“Silly fool!” muttered Luke. “He talks of God as
glibly as any of his father’s idiotic friends. But
perhaps he was mocking! I thought I detected a
tang of irony in his tone.”</p>

<p>“Most of you unbelievers cry upon God when the
real crisis comes,” remarked the priest. “But I like
Philip Wone. I respect him. He, at least, takes his
convictions seriously.”</p>

<p>“I believe you fancy in your heart that some
miracle is going to be worked, to punish my worthy
employer,” observed Luke. “But I assure you,
you’re mistaken. In this world the only way our
Mr. Romers are brought low is by being out-matched
on their own ground. He has a lucky star; but other
people”&mdash;this was added in a low, significant tone&mdash;
“other people may possibly have stars still more
lucky.”</p>

<p>At this moment the cheering and shouting became
deafening. Some new and important event had evidently
occurred. Both men turned and glanced up
at the stucco-fronted edifice that served Yeoborough
as a city-hall. The balcony had become so crowded
that it was difficult to distinguish individual figures;
but there was a general movement there, and people
were talking and gesticulating eagerly. Presently all
these excited persons fell simultaneously into silence,
and an attitude of intense expectation. The crowd
below caught the thrill of their expectancy, and with
upturned faces and eager eyes, waited the event.
There was a most formidable hush over the whole
sea of human heads; and even the detached Luke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
felt his heart beating in tune to the general tension.</p>

<p>In the midst of this impressive silence the burly
figure of the sheriff of the parliamentary district
made his way slowly to the front of the balcony.
With him came the two candidates, each accompanied
by a lady, and grouped themselves on either side
of him. The sheriff standing erect, with a sheet of
paper in his hand, saluted the assembled people, and
proceeded to announce, in simple stentorian words,
the result of the poll.</p>

<p>Clavering had been stricken dumb with amazement
to observe that the lady by Mr. Romer’s side was
not Mrs. Romer, as he had thoughtlessly assumed it
would be, but Gladys herself, exquisitely dressed, and
looking, in her high spirits and excitement, more
lovely than he had ever seen her.</p>

<p>Her fair hair, drawn back from her head beneath a
shady Gainsborough hat, shone like gold in the sunshine.
Her cheeks were flushed, and their delicate
rose-bloom threw into beautiful relief the pallor of
her brow and neck. Her tall girlish figure looked
soft and arresting amid the black-coated politicians
who surrounded her. Her eyes were brilliant.</p>

<p>Contrasted with this splendid apparition at Mr.
Romer’s side, the faded primness of the good spouse
of the Christian Candidate seemed pathetic and grotesque.
Mrs. Wone, in her stiff black dress and
old-fashioned hat, looked as though she were attending
a funeral. Nor was the appearance of her husband
much more impressive or imposing.</p>

<p>Mr. Romer, with his beautiful daughter’s hand
upon his arm, looked as noble a specimen of sage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
authority and massive triumph, as any of that assembled
crowd were likely to see in a life-time. A
spasmodic burst of cheering was interrupted by
vigorous hisses and cries of “Hush! hush! Let the
gentleman speak!”</p>

<p>Lifting his hand with an appropriate air of grave
solemnity, the sheriff proceeded to read: “Result of
the Election in this Parliamentary Division&mdash;Mr.
George Wone, seven thousand one hundred and fifty
nine! Mr. Mortimer Romer, nine thousand eight
hundred and sixty-one! I therefore declare Mr.
Mortimer Romer duly elected.”</p>

<p>A burst of incredible cheering followed this proclamation,
in the midst of which the groans and hisses
of the defeated section were completely drowned.
The cheering was so tremendous and the noisy reaction
after the hours of expectancy so immense, that
it was difficult to catch a word of what either the
successful or the unsuccessful candidate said, as
they made their accustomed valedictory speeches.</p>

<p>Clavering and Luke were swept far apart from
one another in the mad confusion; and it was well
for them both, perhaps, that they were; for before
the speeches were over, or the persons on the balcony
had disappeared into the building, a very strange
and disconcerting event took place.</p>

<p>The unfortunate young Philip, who had received
the announcement of his father’s defeat as a man
might receive a death-sentence, burst into a piercing
and resounding cry, which was clearly audible, not
only to those immediately about him, but to every
one of the ladies and gentlemen assembled on the
balcony. There is no need to repeat in this place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
the words which the unhappy young man hurled at
Mr. Romer and his daughter. Suffice it to say that
they were astounding in their brutality and grossness.</p>

<p>As soon as he had uttered them, Philip sank down
upon the ground, in the miserable convulsions of
some species of epileptic fit. The tragic anxiety of
poor Mrs. Wone, who had not only heard his words,
but seen his collapse, broke up the balcony party in
disorder.</p>

<p>Such is human nature, that though not one of the
aristocratic personages there assembled, believed for
a moment that Philip was anything but a madman;
still, the mere weight of such ominous words, though
flung at random and by one out of his senses, had
an appreciable effect upon them. It was noticed
that one after another they drew away from the
two persons thus challenged; and this, combined
with the movement about the agitated Mrs. Wone,
soon left the father and daughter, the girl clinging to
her parent’s arm, completely isolated.</p>

<p>Before he led Gladys away, however, Mr. Romer
turned a calm and apparently unruffled face upon the
scene below. Luke, who, it may be well believed,
had missed nothing of the subtler aspects of the
situation, was so moved by the man’s imperturbable
serenity that he caught himself on the point of
raising an admiring and congratulatory shout. He
stopped himself in time, however; and in place of
acclaiming the father, did all he could to catch the
eye of the daughter.</p>

<p>In this he was unsuccessful; for the attention of
Gladys, during the brief moment in which she followed
Mr. Romer’s glance over the heads of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
people, was fixed upon the group of persons who
surrounded the prostrate Philip. Among these persons
Luke now recognized, and doubtless the girl had
recognized too, the figure of the vicar of Nevilton.</p>

<p>Luke apostrophized his rival with an ejaculation
of mild contempt. “A good man, that poor priest,”
he muttered, “but a most unmitigated fool! As to
Romer, I commend him! But I think I’ve put a
spoke in the wheel of his good fortune, all the same,
in spite of the planet Jupiter!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">CAESAR’S QUARRY</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Romer’s victory in the election was
attended by a complete lull in the political
world of Nevilton. Nothing but an unavoidable
and drastic crisis, among the ruling circles
of the country, could have precipitated this formidable
struggle in the middle of the holiday-time;
and as soon as the contest was over, the general relaxation
of the season made itself doubly felt.</p>

<p>This lull in the political arena seemed to extend
itself into the sphere of private and individual
emotion, in so far as the persons of our drama were
concerned. The triumphant quarry-owner rested
from his labors under the pleasant warmth of the
drowsy August skies; and as, in the old Homeric
Olympus, a relapse into lethargy of the wielder
of thunder-bolts was attended by a cessation of
earthly strife, so in the Nevilton world, the elements
of discord and opposition fell, during this
siesta of the master of Leo’s Hill, into a state of
quiescent inertia.</p>

<p>But though the gods might sleep, and the people
might relax and play, the watchful unwearied fates
spun on, steadily and in silence, their ineluctable
threads.</p>

<p>The long process of “carrying the corn” was over
at last, and night by night the magic-burdened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
moon grew larger and redder above the misty stubble-fields.</p>

<p>The time drew near for the reception of the successful
candidate’s daughter into the historic church
of the country over which he was now one of the
accredited rulers. A few more drowsy sunshine-drugged
days remained to pass, and the baptism
of Gladys&mdash;followed, a week later, by the formal
imposition of episcopal hands&mdash;would be the signal
for the departure of August and the beginning of
the fall of the leaves.</p>

<p>The end of the second week in September had been
selected for the double marriage, partly because it
synchronized with the annual parish feast-day, and
partly because it supplied Ralph Dangelis with an
excuse for carrying off his bride incontinently to New
York by one of his favourite boats.</p>

<p>Under the quiet surface of this steadily flowing
flood of destiny, which seemed, just then, to be
casting a drowning narcotic spell upon all concerned,
certain deep and terrible misgivings troubled not a
few hearts.</p>

<p>It may be frequently noticed by those whose interest
it is to watch the strange occult harmonies between
the smallest human dramas and their elemental
accomplices, that at these peculiar seasons when
Nature seems to pause and draw in her breath, men
and women find it hard to use or assert their normal
powers of resistance. The planetary influences seem
nearer earth than usual;&mdash;nearer, with the apparent
nearness of the full tide-drawing moon and the
heavy scorching sun;&mdash;and for those more sensitive
souls, whose nerves are easily played upon, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
is produced a certain curious sense of lying back
upon fate, with arms helplessly outspread, and wills
benumbed and passive.</p>

<p>But though some such condition as this had
narcotized all overt resistance to the destiny in store
for her in the heart of Lacrima, it cannot be said
that the Italian’s mind was free from an appalling
shadow. Whether by reason of a remote spark
of humanity in him, or out of subtle fear lest by any
false move he should lose his prey, or because of
some diplomatic and sagacious advice received from
his brother-in-law, Mr. John Goring had, so far, conducted
himself extremely wisely towards his prospective
wife, leaving her entirely untroubled by any
molestations, and never even seeing her except in the
presence of other people. How far this unwonted
restraint was agreeable to the nature of the farmer,
was a secret concealed from all, except perhaps from
his idiot protégé, the only human being in Nevilton
to whom the unattractive man ever confided his
thoughts.</p>

<p>Lacrima had one small and incidental consolation
in feeling that she had been instrumental in sending
to a home for the feeble-minded, the unfortunate
child of the game-keeper of Auber Lake. In this
single particular, Gladys had behaved exceptionally
well, and the news that came of the girl’s steady
progress in the direction of sanity and happiness
afforded some fitful gleam of light in the obscurity
that surrounded the Pariah’s soul.</p>

<p>The nature of this intermittent gleam, its deep
mysterious strength drawn from spiritual sources,
helped to throw a certain sad and pallid twilight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
over her ordained sacrifice. This also she felt was
undertaken, like her visit to Auber Lake, for the sake
of an imprisoned and fettered spirit. If by means of
such self-immolation her friend of Dead Man’s Lane
would be liberated from his servitude and set permanently
upon his feet, her submission would not
be in vain.</p>

<p>She had come once more to feel as though the impending
event were, as far as she was concerned, a
sort of final death-sentence. The passing fantasy,
that in a momentary distortion of her mind had
swept over her of the new life it might mean to have
children of her own, even though born of this unnatural
union, had not approached again the troubled
margin of her spirit.</p>

<p>Even the idea of escaping the Romers was only
vaguely present. She would escape more than the
Romers; she would escape the whole miserable coil of
this wretched existence, if the death she anticipated
fell upon her; for death, and nothing less than
death, seemed the inevitable circumference of the
iron circle that was narrowing in upon her.</p>

<p>Had those two strange phantoms that we have
seen hovering over Nevilton churchyard, representing
in their opposite ways the spiritual powers of the
place, been able to survey&mdash;as who could deny they
might be able?&mdash;the fatal stream which was now
bearing the Pariah forward to the precipice, they
would have been, in their divers tempers, struck
with delight and consternation at the spectacle presented
to them. There was more in this spectacle,
it must be admitted, to bring joy into the heart of
a goblin than into that of an angel. Coincidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
casualty, destiny&mdash;all seemed working together to
effect the unfortunate girl’s destruction.</p>

<p>The fact that, by the recovery of his brother, the
astute Luke Andersen, the only one of all the Nevilton
circle capable of striking an effective blow in
her defence, had been deprived of all but a very
shadowy interest in what befell, seemed an especially
sinister accident. Equally unfortunate was the luckless
chance that at this critical moment had led
the diplomatic Mr. Taxater to see fit to prolong his
stay in London. Mr. Quincunx was characteristically
helpless. James Andersen seemed, since the recovery
of his normal mind, to have subsided like a person
under some restraining vow. Lacrima was a little
surprised that he made no attempt to see her or to
communicate with her. She could only suppose she
had indelibly hurt him, by her rejection of his quixotic
offers, on their way back from Hullaway.</p>

<p>Thus to any ordinary glance, cast upon the field
of events as they were now arranging themselves, it
would have looked as though the Italian’s escape from
the fate hanging over her were as improbable as it
would be for a miracle to intervene to save her.</p>

<p>In spite of the wild threat flung out by Mr. Clavering
in his sudden anger as he waited with Luke in the
Yeoborough street, the vicar of Nevilton made no
attempt to interfere. Whether he really managed to
persuade his conscience that all was well, or whether
he came to the conclusion that without some initiative
from the Italian it would be useless to meddle, not
the most subtle psychologist could say. The fact
remained that the only step he took in the matter
was to assure himself that the girl’s nominal Catholicism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
had so far lapsed into indifference, that she was
likely to raise no objection to a ceremony according
to Anglican ritual.</p>

<p>The whole pitiful situation, indeed, offered only
one more terrible and branding indictment, against
the supine passivity of average human nature in the
presence of unspeakable wrongs. The power and
authority of the domestic system, according to which
the real battle-field of wills takes place out of sight of
the public eye, renders it possible for this inertia of
the ordinary human crowd to cloak itself under a
moral dread of scandal, and under the fear of any
drastic breach of the uniformity of social usage.</p>

<p>A visitor from Mars or Saturn might have supposed,
that in circumstances of this kind, every
decent-thinking person in the village would have
rushed headlong to the episcopal throne, and called
loudly for spiritual mandates to stop the outrage.
Where was the delegated Power of God&mdash;so the forlorn
shadows of the long-evicted Cistercians might
be imagined crying&mdash;whose absolute authority could
be appealed to in face of every worldly force? What
was the tender-souled St. Catharine doing, in her
Paradisiac rest, that she could remain so passively indifferent
to such monstrous and sacrilegious use of
her sacred building? Was it that such transactions
as this, should be carried through, under its very
shelter, that the gentle spirits who guarded the Holy
Rood had made of Nevilton Mount their sacred
resting-place? Must the whole fair tradition of the
spot remain dull, dormant, dumb, while the devotees
of tyranny worked their arbitrary will&mdash;“and nothing
said”?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span></p>

<p>Such imaginary appeals, so fantastic in the utterance,
were indeed, as that large August-moon rose
night by night upon the stubble-fields, far too remote
from Nevilton’s common routine to enter the
heads of any of that simple flock. The morning
mists that diffused themselves, like filmy dream-figures,
over the watchful promontory of Leo’s Hill,
were as capable as any of these villagers of crying aloud
that wrong was being done.</p>

<p>The loneliness in the midst of which Lacrima
moved on her way&mdash;groping, as her enemy had
taunted her with doing, so helplessly with her wistful
hands&mdash;was a loneliness so absolute that it sometimes
seemed to her as if she were already literally
dead and buried. Now and then, with a pallid
phosphorescent glimmer like the gleam of a corpse-light,
the mortal dissolution of all the ties that
bound her to earthly interests, itself threw a fitful
illumination over her consciousness.</p>

<p>But Mr. Romer had over-reached himself in his
main purpose. The moral disintegration which he
looked for, and which the cynical apathy of Mr.
Quincunx encouraged, had, by extending itself to
every nerve of her spirit, rounded itself off, as it
were, full circle, and left her in a mental state rather
beyond both good and evil, than delivered up to the
latter as opposed to the former. The infernal power
might be said to have triumphed; but it could
scarcely be said to have triumphed over a living
soul. It had rather driven her soul far off, far away
from all these contests, into some mysterious
translunar region, where all these distinctions lapsed
and merged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<p>Leo’s Hill itself had never crouched in more taciturn
intentness than it did under that sweltering
August sunshine, which seemed to desire, in the
gradual scorching of the green slopes, to reduce even
the outward skin of the monster to an approximate
conformity with its tawny entrails.</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater’s departure from the scene at this
juncture was not only, little as she knew it, a loss of
support to Lacrima, it was also a very serious blow to
Vennie Seldom.</p>

<p>The priest in Yeoborough, who at her repeated
request had already begun to give her surreptitious
lessons in the Faith, was not in any sense fitted to
be a young neophyte’s spiritual adviser. He was
fat. He was gross. He was lethargic. He was indifferent.
He also absolutely refused to receive her
into the Church without her mother’s sanction. This
refusal was especially troublesome to Vennie. She
knew enough of her mother to know that while it
was her nature to resist blindly and obstinately any
deviation from her will, when once a revolt was an
established fact she would resign herself to it with a
surprising equanimity. To ask Valentia for permission
to be received into the Church would mean
a most violent and distressing scene. To announce
to her that she had been so received, would mean
nothing but melancholy and weary acquiescence.</p>

<p>She felt deeply hurt at Mr. Taxater’s desertion of
her at this moment of all moments. It was incredible
that it was really necessary for him to be so
long in town. As a rule he never left the Gables
during the month of August. His conduct puzzled
and troubled her. Did he care nothing whether she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
became a Catholic or not? Were his lessons mere
casual by-play, to fill up his spare hours in an interesting
and pleasant diversion? Was he really the
faithful friend he called himself? Not only had he
absented himself, but he had done so without sending
her a single word.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it was extremely rare for Mr.
Taxater to write a letter, even to his nearest friends,
except under the stress of theological controversy.
But Vennie knew nothing of this. She simply felt
hurt and injured; as though the one human being,
upon whom she had reposed her trust, had deserted
and betrayed her. He had spoken so tenderly, so
affectionately to her, too, during their last walk together,
before the unfortunate encounter with James
Andersen in the Athelston porch!</p>

<p>It is true that his attitude over that matter of
Andersen’s insanity, and also in the affair of Lacrima’s
marriage, had a little shocked and disconcerted her.
He had bluntly refused to take her into his confidence,
and she felt instinctively that the conversation with
Luke, from which she had been so curtly dismissed,
was of a kind that would have hurt and surprised her.</p>

<p>It seemed unworthy of him to absent himself from
Nevilton, just at the moment when, as she felt certain
in her heart, some grievous outrage was being committed.
She had learned quickly enough of Andersen’s
recovery; but nothing she could learn either lessened
her terrible apprehension about Lacrima, or gave her
the least hint of a path she could follow to do anything
on the Italian’s behalf.</p>

<p>She made a struggle once to see the girl and to
talk to her. But she came away from the hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
interview as perplexed and troubled in her mind as
ever. Lacrima had maintained an obstinate and impenetrable
reserve. Vennie made up her mind that she
would postpone for the present her own religious
revolt, and devote herself to keeping a close and careful
watch upon events in Nevilton.</p>

<p>Mr. Clavering’s present attitude rendered her profoundly
unhappy. The pathetic overtures she had
made to him recently, with a desperate hope of renewing
their friendship on a basis that would be
unaffected even by her change of creed, had seemed
entirely unremarked by the absorbed clergyman.
She could not help brooding sometimes, with a feeling
of wretched humiliation, over the brusqueness and
rudeness which characterized his manner towards her.</p>

<p>She recalled, more often than the priest would
have cared to have known, that pursuit of theirs, of
the demented Andersen, and how in his annoyance
and confusion he had behaved to her in a fashion
not only rough but positively unkind.</p>

<p>It was clear that he was growing more and more
slavishly infatuated with Gladys; and Vennie could
only pray that the days might pass quickly and the
grotesque blasphemy of the confirmation service be
carried through and done with, so that the evil spell
of her presence should be lifted and broken.</p>

<p>Prayer indeed&mdash;poor little forlorn saint!&mdash;was all
that was left to her, outside her mother’s exacting
affection, and she made a constant and desperate use
of it. Only the little painted wooden image, in her
white-washed room, a pathetic reproduction of the
famous Nuremburg Madonna, could have betrayed
how long were the hours in which she gave herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
up to these passionate appeals. She prayed for
Clavering in that shy heart-breaking manner&mdash;never
whispering his name, even to the ears of Our Lady,
but always calling him “He” and “Him”&mdash;in which
girls are inclined to pray for the man to whom they
have sacrificed their peace. She prayed desperately
for Lacrima, that at the last moment, contrary to all
hope, some intervention might arrive.</p>

<p>Thus it came about, that beneath the roofs of
Nevilton&mdash;for neither James Andersen nor Mr.
Quincunx were “praying men”&mdash;only one voice
was lifted up, the voice of the last of the old race
of the place’s rulers, to protest against the flowing
forward to its fatal end, of this evil tide.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, things moved steadily and irresistibly
on; and it seemed as though it were as improbable
that those shimmering mists which every evening
crept up the sides of Leo’s Hill should endure the
heat of the August noons, as that the prayers of this
frail child should change the course of ordained
destiny.</p>

<p>If none but her little painted Madonna knew how
passionate were Vennie’s spiritual struggles; not even
that other Vennie, of the long-buried royal court,
whose mournful nun’s eyes looked out upon the great
entrance-hall, knew what turbulent thoughts and
anxieties possessed the soul of Gladys Romer.</p>

<p>Was Mr. Taxater right in the formidable hint he
had given the young stone-carver, as to the result
of his amour with his employer’s daughter? Was
Gladys not only the actual mistress of Luke, but the
prospective mother of a child of their strange love?</p>

<p>Whatever were the fair-haired girl’s thoughts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
apprehensions, she kept them rigidly to herself; and
not even Lacrima, in her wildest imagination, ever
dreamed that things had gone as far as that. If it
had chanced to be, as Mr. Taxater supposed, and
as Luke seemed willing to admit, Gladys was apparently
relying upon some vague accident in the
course of events, or upon some hidden scheme of her
own, to escape the exposure which the truth of such
a supposition seemed to render inevitable.</p>

<p>The fact remained that she let matters drift on,
and continued to prepare&mdash;in her own fashion&mdash;not
only for her reception into the Church of England,
but for her marriage to the wealthy American.</p>

<p>Dangelis was continually engaged now in running
backwards and forwards to town on business connected
with his marriage; and with a view to making these
trips more pleasantly and conveniently he had acquired
a smart touring-car of his own, which he soon
found himself able to drive without assistance. The
pleasure of these excursions, leading him, in delicious
solitude, through so many unvisited country places
and along such historic roads, had for the moment
distracted his attention from his art.</p>

<p>He rarely took Gladys with him; partly because he
regarded himself as still but a learner in the science
of driving, but more because he felt, at this critical
moment of his life, an extraordinary desire to be alone
with his own thoughts. Most of these thoughts, it is
true, were such as it would not have hurt the feelings
of his fiancée to have surprised in their passage
through his mind; but not quite all of them. Ever
since the incident of Auber Lake, an incident which
threw the character of his betrothed into no very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
charming light, Dangelis had had his moments of
uneasiness and misgiving. He could not altogether
conceal from himself that his attraction to Gladys
was rather of a physical than of a spiritual, or even
of a psychic nature.</p>

<p>Once or twice, while the noble expanses of Salisbury
Plain or the New Forest thrilled him with a
pure dilation of soul, as he swept along in the clear
air, he was on the verge of turning his car straight
to the harbour of Southampton and taking the first
boat that offered itself, bound East, West, North or
South&mdash;it mattered nothing the direction!&mdash;so that
an impassable gulf of free sea-water should separate
him forever from the hot fields and woods of Nevilton.</p>

<p>Once, when reaching a cross-road point, where the
name of the famous harbour stared at him from a
sign-post, he had even gone so far as to deviate to
the extent of several miles from his normal road.
But that intolerable craving for the girl’s soft-clinging
arms and supple body, with which she had at last
succeeded in poisoning the freedom of his mind, drew
him back with the force of a magnet.</p>

<p>The day at length approached, when, on the
festival of his favorite saint, Mr. Clavering was to
perform the ceremony, to which he had looked forward
so long and with such varied feelings. It was
Saturday, and on the following morning, in a service
especially arranged to take place privately, between
early celebration and ordinary matins, Gladys was
to be baptized.</p>

<p>Dangelis had suddenly declared his intention of
making his escape from a proceeding which to his
American mind seemed entirely uncalled for, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
his pagan humour seemed not a little grotesque. He
had decided to start, immediately after breakfast,
and motor to London, this time by way of Trowbridge
and Westbury.</p>

<p>The confirmation ceremony, for reasons connected
with the convenience of the Lord Bishop, had been
finally fixed for the ensuing Wednesday, so that only
two days were destined to elapse between the girl’s
reception into the Church, and her admission to its
most sacred rites. Dangelis was sufficiently a heathen
to desire to be absent from this event also, though
he had promised Mr. Clavering to support his betrothed
on the occasion of her first Communion on
the following Sunday, which would be their last
Sunday together as unwedded lovers.</p>

<p>On this occasion, Gladys persuaded him to let her
ride by his side a few miles along the Yeoborough
road. They had just reached the bridge across the
railway-line, about a mile and a half from the village,
when they caught sight of Mr. John Goring, returning
from an early visit to the local market.</p>

<p>Gladys made the artist stop the car, and she got
out to speak to her uncle. After a minute or two’s
conversation, she informed Dangelis that she would
return with Mr. Goring by the field-path, which left
the road at that point and followed the track of the
railway. The American, obedient to her wish, set
his car in motion, and waving her a gay good-bye, disappeared
swiftly round an adjacent corner.</p>

<p>Gladys and her uncle proceeded to walk slowly
homeward, across the meadows; neither of them,
however, paying much attention to the charm of the
way. In vain from the marshy hollows between their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
path and the metal track, certain brilliant clumps of
ragged robin and red rattle signalled to them to
pause and admire. Gladys and Mr. Goring strolled
forward, past these allurements, with a superb absorption
in their own interests.</p>

<p>“I can’t think, uncle,” Gladys was saying, “how
it is that you can go on in the way you’re doing;
you, a properly engaged person, and not seeing anything
of your young lady?”</p>

<p>The farmer laughed. “Ah! my dear, but what
matter? I shall see her soon enough; all I want to,
may-be.”</p>

<p>“But most engaged people like to see a little of
one another before they’re married, don’t they,
uncle? I know Ralph would be quite mad if he
couldn’t see <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>“But, my pretty, this is quite a different case.
When Bert and I”&mdash;he spoke of the idiot as if
they had been comrades, instead of master and
servant&mdash;“have bought a new load of lop-ears, we
never tease ’em or fret ’em before we get ’em home.”</p>

<p>“But Lacrima isn’t a rabbit!” cried Gladys impatiently;
“she’s a girl like me, and wants what all
girls want, to be petted and spoilt a little before
she’s plunged into marriage.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t strike me as wanting anything of that
kind, when I made up to her in our parlour,” replied
Mr. Goring.</p>

<p>“Oh you dear old stupid!” cried his niece, “can’t
you understand that’s what we’re all like? We all
put on airs, and have fancies, and look cross; but
we want to be petted all the same. We want it all
the more!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reckon I’d better leave well alone all the same,
just at present,” observed the farmer. “If I was to
go stroking her and making up to her, while she’s
on the road, may-be when we got her into the hutch
she’d bite like a weasel.”</p>

<p>“She’d never really bite!” retorted his companion.
“You don’t know her as well as I do. I tell you,
uncle, she’s got no more spirit than a tame pigeon.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” said the farmer.</p>

<p>Gladys flicked the grass impatiently with the end
of her parasol.</p>

<p>“You may take my word for it, uncle,” she continued.
“The whole thing’s put on. It’s all affectation
and nonsense. Do you think she’d have agreed
to marry you if she wasn’t ready for a little fun?
Of course she’s ready! She’s only waiting for you to
begin. It makes it more exciting for her, when she
cries out and looks injured. That’s the only reason
why she does it. Lots of girls are like that, you
know!”</p>

<p>“Are they, my pretty, are they? ’Tis difficult to
tell that kind, may-be, from the other kind. But
I’m not a man for too much of these fancy ways.”</p>

<p>“You’re not drawing back, uncle, are you?” cried
Gladys, in considerable alarm.</p>

<p>“God darn me, no!” replied the farmer. “I’m
going to carry this business through. Don’t you fuss
yourself. Only I like doing these things in my own
way&mdash;dost understand me, my dear?&mdash;in my own
way; and then, if so be they go wrong, I can’t put
the blame on no one else.”</p>

<p>“I wonder you aren’t more keen, uncle,” began
Gladys insinuatingly, following another track, “to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
see more of a pretty girl you’re just going to marry.
I don’t believe you half know how pretty she is!
I wish you could see her doing her hair in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“I shall see her, soon enough, my lass; don’t
worry,” replied the farmer.</p>

<p>“I should so love to see you give her one kiss,”
murmured Gladys. “Of course, she’d struggle and
make a fuss, but she’d really be enjoying it all the
time.”</p>

<p>“May-be she would, my pretty, and may-be she
wouldn’t. I’m not one that likes hearing either
rabbits or maidens start the squealing game. It fair
gives me the shivers. Bert, he can stand it, but I
never could. It’s nature, I suppose. A man can’t
change his nature no more than a cow nor a horse.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand you, uncle,” observed Gladys.
“If I were in your place, I’m sure I shouldn’t be
satisfied without at least kissing the girl I was going
to marry. I’d find some way of getting round her,
however sulky she was. Oh, I’m sure you don’t half
know how nice Lacrima is to kiss!”</p>

<p>“I suppose she isn’t so mighty different, come to
that,” replied the farmer, “than any other maid. I
don’t mind if I give <em>you</em> a kiss, my beauty!” he
added, encircling his niece with an affectionate embrace
and kissing her flushed cheek. “There&mdash;there!
Best let well alone, sweetheart, and leave your old
uncle to manage his own little affairs according to
his own fashion!”</p>

<p>But Gladys was not so easily put off. She had
recourse to her fertile imagination.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span></p>
<p>“You should have heard what she said to me the
other night, uncle. You know the way girls talk?
or you ought to, anyhow! She said she hoped you’d
go on being the same simple fool, after you were
married. She said she’d find it mighty easy to twist
you round her finger. ‘Why,’ she said, ‘I can do
what I like with him now. He treats me as if I
were a high-born lady and he were a mere common
man. I believe he’s downright afraid of me!’ That’s
the sort of things she says about you, uncle. She
thinks in her heart that you’re just a fool, a simple
frightened fool!”</p>

<p>“Darn her! she does, does she?” cried Mr. Goring,
touched at last by the serpent’s tongue. “She thinks
I’m a fool, does she? Well! Let her have her laugh.
Them laughs best as laughs last, in my thinking!”</p>

<p>“Yes, she thinks you’re a great big silly fool, uncle.
Of course it’s all pretence, her talk about wanting
you to be like that; but that’s what she thinks you
are. What she’d really like&mdash;only she doesn’t say
so, even to me&mdash;would be for you to catch her
suddenly round the waist and kiss her on the mouth,
and laugh at her pretendings. I expect she’s waiting
to give you a chance to do something of that sort;
only you don’t come near her. Oh, she must think
you’re a monstrous fool! She must chuckle to herself
to think what a fool you are.”</p>

<p>“I’ll teach her what kind of a fool I am,” muttered
Mr. Goring, “when I’ve got her to myself, up at the
farm. This business of dangling after a maid’s
apron strings, this kissing and cuddling, don’t suit
somehow with my nature. I’m not one of your
fancy-courting ones and never was!”</p>

<p>“Listen, uncle!” said Gladys eagerly, laying her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
hand on his arm. “Suppose I was to take her up
to Cæsar’s Quarry this afternoon? That would be a
lovely chance! You could come strolling round about
four o’clock. I’d be on the watch; and before she
knew you were there, I’d scramble out, and you
could climb down. She couldn’t get away from you,
and you’d have quite a nice little bit of love-making.”</p>

<p>Mr. Goring paused, and prodded the ground with
the end of his stick.</p>

<p>“What a little devil you are!” he exclaimed.
“Darn me if this here job isn’t a queer business!
Here are you, putting yourself out and fussing
around, only for a fellow to have what’s due to him.
You leave us alone, sweetheart, my young lady and
me! I reckon we know what’s best for ourselves,
without you thrusting your hand in.”</p>

<p>“But you might just walk up that way, uncle; it
isn’t far over the hill. I’d give&mdash;oh, I don’t know
what!&mdash;to see you two together. She wants to be
teased a little, you know! She’s getting too proud
and self-satisfied for anything. It would do her ever
so much good to be taught a lesson. It isn’t much
to do, is it? Just to give the girl you’re going to
marry one little kiss?”</p>

<p>“But how do I know you two wenches aren’t
fooling me, even now?” protested the cautious
farmer. “’Tis just the sort of maids’ trick ye might
set out to play upon a man. How do I know ye
haven’t put your two darned little heads together
over this job?”</p>

<p>Gladys looked round. They were approaching the
Mill Copse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>“Please, uncle,” she cried, “don’t say such things
to me. You know I wouldn’t join with anyone
against you. Least of all with her! Just do as I
tell you, and stroll up to Cæsar’s Quarry about four
o’clock. I promise you faithfully I haven’t said a
word to her about it. Please, uncle, be nice and
kind over this.”</p>

<p>She threw her arms round Mr. Goring’s neck.
“You haven’t done anything for me for a long time,”
she murmured in her most persuasive tone. “Do
you remember how I used to give you butterfly-kisses
when I was a little girl, and you kept apples
for me in the big loft?”</p>

<p>Mr. Goring’s nature may, or may not have been,
as he described it; it is certain that the caresses and
cajoleries of his lovely niece had an instantaneous
effect upon him. His slow-witted suspicions melted
completely under the spell of her touch.</p>

<p>“Well, my pretty,” he said, as they moved on,
under the shadowy trees of the park, “may-be, if
I’ve nothing else to do and things seem quiet, I’ll
take a bit of a walk this afternoon. But you mustn’t
count on it. If I do catch sight of ’ee, ’round
Cæsar’s way, I’ll let ’ee know. But ’tisn’t a downright
promise, mind!”</p>

<p>Gladys clapped her hands. “You’re a perfect love,
uncle!” she cried jubilantly. “I wish I were Lacrima;
I’d be ever, ever so nice to you!”</p>

<p>“Ye can be nice to me, as ’tis, sweetheart,” replied
the farmer. “You and me have always been
kind of fond of each other, haven’t us? But I reckon
ye’d best be slipping off now, up to your house. I
never care greatly for meeting your father by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
accident-like. He’s one of these sly ones that always
makes a fellow feel squeamy and leery.”</p>

<p>That afternoon it happened that the adventurous
Luke had planned a trip down to Weymouth, with a
new flame of his, a certain Polly Shadow, whose
parents kept a tobacco-shop in Yeoborough.</p>

<p>He had endeavoured to persuade his brother to
accompany them on this little excursion, in the hope
that a breath of sea-air might distract and refresh
him; but James had expressed his intention of paying
a visit to his gentle restorer, up at Wild Pine,
who was now sufficiently recovered to enable her to
sit out in the shade of the great trees.</p>

<p>The church clock had just struck three, when James
Andersen approached the entrance to Nevil’s Gully.</p>

<p>He had not advanced far into the shadow of the
beeches, when he heard the sound of voices. He
paused, and listened. The clear tones of Ninsy
Lintot were unmistakable, and he thought he detected&mdash;though
of this he was not sure&mdash;the
nervous high-pitched voice of Philip Wone. From the
direction of the sounds, he gathered that the two
young people were seated somewhere on the bracken-covered
slope above the barton, where, as he well
knew, there were several shady terraces overlooking
the valley.</p>

<p>Unwilling to plunge suddenly into a conversation
that appeared, as far as he could catch its purport,
to be of considerable emotional tension, Andersen
cautiously ascended the moss-grown bank on his
left, and continued his climb, until he had reached
the crest of the hill. He then followed, as silently as
he could, the little grassy path between the stubble-field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
and the thickets, until he came to the open
space immediately above these fern-covered terraces.</p>

<p>Yes, his conjecture had been right. Seated side
by side beneath the tall-waving bracken, the auburn-haired
Ninsy and her anarchist friend were engaged
in an absorbing and passionate discussion. Both of
them were bare-headed, and the young man’s hand
rested upon the motionless fingers of his companion,
which were clasped demurely upon her lap. Philip’s
voice was raised in intense and pitiful supplication.</p>

<p>“I’d care for you day and night,” Andersen heard
him cry. “I’d nurse you when you were ill, and
keep you from every kind of annoyance.”</p>

<p>“But, Philip dear,” the girl’s voice answered, “you
know what the doctor said. He said I mustn’t marry
on any account. So even if I had nothing against it,
it wouldn’t be possible for us to do this.”</p>

<p>“Ninsy, Ninsy!” cried the youth pathetically,
“don’t you understand what I mean? I can’t bear
having to say these things, but you force me to,
when you talk like that. The doctor meant that it
would be wrong for you to have children, and he took
it for granted that you’d never find anyone ready
to live with you as I’d live with you. It would only
be a marriage in name. I mean it would only be a
marriage in name in regard to children. It would be
a real marriage to me, it would be heaven to me, to
live side by side with you, and no one able any more
to come between us! I can’t realize such happiness.
It makes me feel dizzy even to think of it!”</p>

<p>Ninsy unclasped her hands, and gently repulsing
him, remained buried in deep thought. Standing erect
above them, like a sentry upon a palisade, James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
Andersen stared gloomily down upon this little drama.
In some strange way,&mdash;perhaps because of some
sudden recurrence of his mental trouble,&mdash;he seemed
quite unconscious of anything dishonourable or base
in thus withholding from these two people the knowledge
that he was overhearing them.</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of you to the end of my life!” the
young man repeated. “I’m doing quite well now
with my work. You’ll be able to have all you want.
You’ll be better off than you are here, and you know
perfectly well that as soon as your father’s free
he’ll marry that friend of his in Yeoborough. I
saw him with her last Sunday. I’m sure it’s only for
your sake that he stays single. She’s got three
children, and that’s what holds him back&mdash;that,
and the thought that you two mightn’t get on together.
You’d be doing your father a kindness if you
said yes to me, Ninsy. Please, please, my darling,
say it, and make me grateful to you forever!”</p>

<p>“I can’t say it,&mdash;Philip, dear, I can’t, I can’t”;
murmured the girl, in a voice so low that the sentinel
above them could only just catch her words. “I do
care for you, and I do value your goodness to me,
but I can’t say the words, Philip. Something seems
to stop me, something in my throat.”</p>

<p>It was not to her throat however, that the agitated
Ninsy raised her thin hands. As she pressed
them against her breast a look of tragic sorrow came
into her face. Philip regarded her wistfully.</p>

<p>“You’re thinking you don’t love me, dear,&mdash;and
never can love me. I know that, well enough! I
know you don’t love me as I love you. But what
does that matter? I’ve known that, all the time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
The thing is, you won’t find anyone who loves you as
I do,&mdash;ready to live with you as I’ve said I will,
ready to nurse you and look after you. Other people’s
love will be always asking and demanding from you.
Mine&mdash;oh, it’s true, my darling, it’s true!&mdash;mine
only wants to give up everything to make you
happy.”</p>

<p>Ninsy was evidently more than a little moved by
the boy’s appeal. There was a ring of passionate
sincerity in his tone which went straight to her
heart. She bent down and covered her face with her
hands. When at length she lifted up her head and
answered him, there were tears on her cheeks, and
the watchful listener above them did not miss the
quiver in her tone.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Philip boy, more sorry than I can
say, that I can’t be nicer to you, that I can’t show
my gratitude to you, in the way you wish. But
though I do care for you, and&mdash;and value your
dear love&mdash;something stops me, something makes
it impossible that this should happen.”</p>

<p>“I believe it’s because you love that fellow Andersen!”
cried the excited youth, leaping to his feet in
his agitation.</p>

<p>In making this movement, the figure of the stone-carver,
silhouetted with terrible distinctness against
the sky-line, became visible to him. Instinctively he
uttered a cry of surprise and anger.</p>

<p>“What do you want here? You’ve been listening!
You’ve been spying on us! Get away, can’t you!
Get back to your pretty young lady&mdash;her that’s
going to marry John Goring for the sake of his
money! Clear out of this, do you hear? Ninsy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
sick of you and your ways. Clear off! or I’ll make you&mdash;eavesdropper!”</p>

<p>By this time Ninsy had also risen, and stood facing
the figure above them. Every vestige of colour had
left her cheeks, and her hand was pressed against her
side. Andersen made a curious incoherent sound and
took a step towards them.</p>

<p>“Get away, can’t you!” reiterated the furious
youth. “You’ve caused enough trouble here already.
Look at her,&mdash;can’t you see how ill she is? Get
back&mdash;damn you!&mdash;unless you want to kill her.”</p>

<p>Ninsy certainly looked as though in another moment
she were going to fall. She made a piteous
little gesture, as if to ward off from Andersen the
boy’s savage words, but Philip caught her passionately
round the waist.</p>

<p>“Get away!” he cried once more. “She belongs to
me now. You might have had her, you coward&mdash;you
turn-coat!&mdash;but you let her go for your newer
prey. Oh, you’re a fine gentleman, James Andersen,
a fine faithful gentleman! <em>You</em> don’t hold with
strikes. <em>You</em> don’t hold with workmen rising against
masters. <em>You</em> hold with keeping in with those that
are in power. Clear off&mdash;eavesdropper! Get back
to Mistress John Goring and your nice brother!
He’s as pretty a gentleman as you are, with his dear
Miss Gladys!”</p>

<p>Ninsy’s feet staggered beneath her and she began
to hang limp upon his arm. She opened her mouth
to speak, but could only gasp helplessly. Her wide-open
eyes&mdash;staring from her pallid face&mdash;never left
Andersen for a moment. Of Philip she seemed absolutely
unconscious. The stone-carver made another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
step down the hill. His eyes, too, were fixed intently
on the girl, and of his rival’s angry speeches he seemed
utterly oblivious.</p>

<p>“Get away!” the boy reiterated, beside himself
with fury, supporting the drooping form of his companion
as if its weight were nothing. “We’ve had
enough of your shilly-shallying and trickery! We’ve
had enough of your fine manners! A damned cowardly
spy&mdash;that’s what I call you, you well-behaved
gentleman! Get back&mdash;can’t you!”</p>

<p>The drooping girl uttered some incoherent words
and made a helpless gesture with her hand. Andersen
seemed to read her meaning in her eyes, for he paused
abruptly in his approach and stretched out his arms.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Ninsy!” he murmured in a low voice.
He said no more, and turning on his heel, scrambled
swiftly back over the crest of the ridge and disappeared
from view.</p>

<p>Philip flung a parting taunt after him, and then,
lifting the girl bodily off her feet, staggered down
the slope to the cottage, holding her in his arms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile James Andersen walked swiftly across
the stubble-field in the direction of Leo’s Hill. At
the pace he moved it only took him some brief
minutes to reach the long stone wall that separates,
in this quarter, the quarried levels of the promontory
from the high arable lands which abut upon it.</p>

<p>He climbed over this barrier and strode blindly
and recklessly forward among the slippery grassy
paths that crossed one another along the edges of
the deeper pits.</p>

<p>The stone-carver was approaching, though quite
unconsciously, the scene of a very remarkable drama.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
Some fifteen minutes before his approach, the two
girls from Nevilton House had reached the precipitous
edge of what was known in that locality as
Cæsar’s Quarry. Cæsar’s Quarry was a large disused
pit, deeper and more extensive than most of the old
excavations on the Hill, and surrounded, on all but
one side, by blank precipitous walls of weather-stained
sandstone. These walls of smooth stone
remained always dark and damp, whatever the temperature
might be of the air above them; and the
floor of the Quarry was composed of a soft verdant
carpet of cool moist moss, interspersed by stray
heaps of discoloured rubble, on which flourished, at
this particular season of the year, masses of that
sombre-foliaged weed known as wormwood.</p>

<p>On the northern side of Cæsar’s Quarry rose a high
narrow ridge of rock, divided, at uneven spaces, by
deeply cut fissures or chasms, some broad and some
narrow, but all overgrown to the very edge by short
slippery grass. This ridge, known locally as Claudy’s
Leap, was a favourite venture-place of the more
daring among the children of the neighbourhood, who
would challenge one another to feats of courage and
agility, along its perilous edge.</p>

<p>On the side of Claudy’s Leap, opposite from Cæsar’s
Quarry, was a second pit, of even deeper descent than
the other, but of much smaller expanse. This second
quarry, also disused for several generations, remained
so far nameless, destiny having, it might seem, withheld
the baptismal honour, until the place had earned
a right to it by becoming the scene of some tragic,
or otherwise noteworthy, event.</p>

<p>Gladys and Lacrima approached Cæsar’s Quarry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
from the western side, from whose slope a little
winding path&mdash;the only entrance or exit attainable&mdash;led
down into its shadowy depths. The Italian
glanced with a certain degree of apprehension into
the gulf beneath her, but Gladys seemed to take the
thing so much for granted, and appeared so perfectly
at her ease, that she was ashamed to confess her
tremors. The elder girl, indeed, continued chatting
cheerfully to her companion about indifferent matters,
and as she clambered down the little path in front
of her, she turned once or twice, in her fluent discourse,
to make sure that Lacrima was following.
The two cousins stood for awhile in silence, side by
side, when they reached the bottom.</p>

<p>“How nice and cool it is!” cried Gladys, after a
pause. “I was getting scorched up there! Let’s sit
down a little, shall we,&mdash;before we start back? I
love these old quarries.”</p>

<p>They sat down, accordingly, upon a heap of stones,
and Gladys serenely continued her chatter, glancing
up, however, now and again, to the frowning ridges
of the precipices above them.</p>

<p>They had not waited long in this way, when the
quarry-owner’s daughter gave a perceptible start, and
raised her hand quickly to her lips.</p>

<p>Her observant eye had caught sight of the figure
of Mr. John Goring peering down upon them from
the opposite ridge. Had Lacrima observed this
movement and lifted her eyes too, she would have
received a most invaluable warning, but the Powers
whoever they may have been, who governed the
sequence of events upon Leo’s Hill, impelled her to
keep her head lowered, and her interest concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
upon a tuft of curiously feathered moss. Gladys
remained motionless for several moments, while the
figure on the opposite side vanished as suddenly as it
had appeared. Then she slowly rose.</p>

<p>“Oh, how silly I am,” she cried; “I’ve dropped that
bunch of marjoram. Stop a minute, dear. Don’t
move! I’ll just run up and get it. It was in the
path. I know exactly where!”</p>

<p>“I’ll come with you if you like,” said Lacrima
listlessly, “then you won’t have to come back. Or
why not leave it for a moment?”</p>

<p>“It’s on the path, I tell you!” cried her cousin,
already some way up the slope; “I’m scared of someone
taking it. Marjoram isn’t common about here.
Oh no! Stay where you are. I’ll be back in a
second.”</p>

<p>The Italian relapsed into her former dreamy unconcern.
She listlessly began stripping the leaves
from a spray of wormwood which grew by her side.
The place where she sat was in deep shadow, though
upon the summit of the opposite ridge the sun lay hot.
Her thoughts hovered about her friend in Dead Man’s
Lane. She had vaguely hoped to get a glimpse of
him this afternoon, but the absence of Dangelis had
interfered with this.</p>

<p>She began building fantastic castles in the air,
trying to call up the image of a rejuvenated Mr.
Quincunx, freed from all cares and worries, living the
placid epicurean life his heart craved. Would he,
she wondered, recognize then, what her sacrifice
meant? Or would he remain still obsessed by this
or the other cynical fantasy, as far from the real
truth of things as a madman’s dream? She smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
gently to herself as she thought of her friend’s
peculiarities. Her love for him, as she felt it now,
across a quivering gulf of misty space, was a thing
as humorously tolerant and tender as it might have
been had they been man and wife of many years’
standing. In these things Lacrima’s Latin blood gave
her a certain maturity of feeling, and emphasized
the maternal element in her attachment.</p>

<p>She contemplated dreamily the smooth bare walls
of the cavernous arena in which she sat. Their
coolness and dampness was not unpleasant after the
heat of the upper air, but there was something
sepulchral about them, something that gave the girl
the queer impression of a colossal tomb&mdash;a tomb
whose scattered bones might even now be lying,
washed by centuries of rain, under the rank weeds of
these heaps of rubble.</p>

<p>She heard the sound of someone descending the
path behind her but, taking for granted that it was
her cousin, she did not turn her head. It was only
when the steps were quite close that she recognized
that they were too heavy to be those of a girl.</p>

<p>Then she leapt to her feet, and swung round,&mdash;to
find herself confronted by the sturdy figure of Mr.
John Goring. She gave a wild cry of panic and fled
blindly across the smooth floor of the great quarry.
Mr. Goring followed her at his leisure.</p>

<p>The girl’s terror was so great, that, hardly conscious
of what she did, she ran desperately towards the remotest
corner of the excavation, where some ancient
blasting-process had torn a narrow crevice out of
the solid rock. This direction of her flight made the
farmer’s pursuit of her a fatally easy undertaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
for the great smooth walls closed in, at a sharp angle,
at that point, and the crevice, where the two walls
met, only sank a few feet into the rock.</p>

<p>Mr. Goring, observing the complete hopelessness
of the girl’s mad attempt to escape him, proceeded
to advance towards her as calmly and leisurely as if
she had been some hare or rabbit he had just shot.
The fact that Lacrima had chosen this particular
cul-de-sac, on the eastern side of the quarry, was a
most felicitous accident for Gladys, for it enabled
her to watch the event with as much ease as if she
had been a Drusilla or a Livia, seated in the Roman
amphitheatre. The fair-haired girl crept to the
extreme brink of the steep descent and there, lying
prone on the thyme-scented grass, her chin propped
upon her hands, she followed with absorbed interest
the farmer’s movements as he approached his recalcitrant
fiancée.</p>

<p>The terrified girl soon found out the treachery of
the panic-instinct which had led her into this trap.
Had she remained in the open, it is quite possible
that by a little manœuvring she could have escaped;
but now her only exit was blocked by her advancing
pursuer.</p>

<p>Turning to face him, and leaning back against the
massive wall of stone, she stretched out her arms on
either side of her, seizing convulsively in her fingers
some tufts of knot-grass which grew on the surface
of the rock. Here, with panting bosom and pallid
cheeks, she awaited his approach. Her tense figure
and terror-stricken gaze only needed the imprisoning
fetters to have made of her an exact modern image
of the unfortunate Andromeda. She neither moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
nor uttered the least cry, as Mr. Goring drew near
her.</p>

<p>At that moment a wild and unearthly shout reverberated
through the quarry. The sound of it&mdash;caught
up by repeated echoes&mdash;went rolling away across
Leo’s Hill, frightening the sheep and startling the cider-drinkers
in the lonely Inn. Gladys leapt to her feet,
ran round to where the path descended, and began
hastily scrambling down. Mr. Goring retreated hurriedly
into the centre of the arena, and with his hand
shading his eyes gazed up at the intruder.</p>

<p>It was no light-footed Perseus, who on behalf of this
forlorn child of classic shores, appeared as if from the
sky. It was, indeed, only the excited figure of James
Andersen that Mr. Goring’s gaze, and Lacrima’s
bewildered glance, encountered simultaneously. The
stone-carver seemed to be possessed by a legion of
devils. His first thundering shout was followed by
several others, each more terrifying than the last,
and Gladys, rushing past the astonished farmer,
seized Lacrima by the arm.</p>

<p>“Come!” she cried. “Uncle was a brute to frighten
you. But, for heaven’s sake, let’s get out of this,
before that madman collects a crowd! They’ll all
be down here from the inn in another moment.
Quick, dear, quick! Our only chance is to get away
now.”</p>

<p>Lacrima permitted her cousin to hurry her across
the quarry and up the path. As they neared the
summit of the slope the Italian turned and looked
back. Mr. Goring was still standing where they had
left him, gazing with petrified interest at the wild
gestures of the man above him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span></p>

<p>Andersen seemed beside himself. He kept frantically
waving his arms, and seemed engaged in some
incoherent defiance of the invisible Powers of the
air. Lacrima, as she looked at him, became convinced
that he was out of his mind. She could not even
be quite clear if he recognized her. She was certain
that it was not against her assailant that his wild
cries and defiances were hurled. It did not appear
that he was even aware of the presence of the farmer.
Whether or not he had seen her and known her when
he uttered his first cry, she could not tell. It
was certainly against no earthly enemies that the
man was struggling now.</p>

<p>Vennie Seldom might have hazarded the superstitious
suggestion that his fit was not madness at all
but a sudden illumination, vouchsafed to his long
silence, of the real conditions of the airy warfare that
is being constantly waged around us. At that moment,
Vennie might have said, James Andersen was
the only perfectly sane person among them, for to his
eyes alone, the real nature of that heathen place and
its dark hosts was laid manifestly bare. The man,
according to this strange view, was wrestling to the
death, in his supreme hour, against the Forces that
had not only darkened his own days and those of
Lacrima, but had made the end of his mother’s life
so tragic and miserable.</p>

<p>Gladys dragged Lacrima away as soon as they
reached the top of the ascent but the Pariah had
time to mark the last desperate gesture of her deliverer
before he vanished from her sight over the
ridge.</p>

<p>Mr. Goring overtook them before they had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
far, and walked on with them, talking to Gladys
about Andersen’s evident insanity.</p>

<p>“It’s no good my trying to do anything,” he remarked.
“But I’ll send Bert round for Luke as soon
as I get home. Luke’ll bring him to his senses. They
say he’s been taken like this before, and has come
round. He hears voices, you know, and fancies
things.”</p>

<p>They walked in silence along the high upland road
that leads from the principal quarries of the Hill to
the Wild Pine hamlet and Nevil’s Gully. When they
reached the latter place, the two girls went on, down
Root-Thatch Lane, and Mr. Goring took the field-path
to the Priory.</p>

<p>Before they separated, the farmer turned to his
future bride, who had been careful to keep Gladys
between herself and him, and addressed her in the
most gentle voice he knew how to assume.</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry with me, lass,” he said. “I was
only teasing, just now. ’Twas a poor jest may-be,
and ye’ve cause to look glowering. But when we
two be man and wife ye’ll find I’m a sight better
to live with than many a fair-spoken one. These
be queer times, and like enough I seem a queer fellow,
but things’ll settle themselves. You take my
word for it!”</p>

<p>Lacrima could only murmur a faint assent in reply
to these words, but as she entered with Gladys the
shadow of the tunnel-like lane, she could not help
thinking that her repulsion to this man, dreadful
though it was, was nothing in comparison with the
fear and loathing with which she regarded Mr.
Romer. Contrasted with his sinister relative, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
John Goring was, after all, no more than a rough
simpleton.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on Leo’s Hill, an event of tragic significance
had occurred. It will be remembered that
the last Lacrima had seen of James Andersen was the
wild final gesticulation he made,&mdash;a sort of mad
appeal to the Heavens against the assault of invisible
enemies,&mdash;before he vanished from sight on the
further side of Claudy’s Leap. This vanishing, just
at that point, meant no more to Lacrima than that
he had probably taken a lower path, but had Gladys
or Mr. Goring witnessed it,&mdash;or any other person
who knew the topography of the place,&mdash;a much
more startling conclusion would have been inevitable.
Nor would such a conclusion have been incorrect.</p>

<p>The unfortunate man, forgetting, in his excitement,
the existence of the other quarry, the nameless one;
forgetting in fact that Claudy’s Leap was a razor’s
edge between two precipices, had stepped heedlessly
backwards, after his final appeal to Heaven, and
fallen, without a cry, straight into the gulf.</p>

<p>The height of his fall would, in any case, have
probably killed him, but as it was “he dashed his
head,” in the language of the Bible, “against a stone”;
and in less than a second after his last cry, his soul,
to use the expression of a more pagan scripture,
“was driven, murmuring, into the Shades.”</p>

<p>It fell to the lot, therefore, not of Luke, who did
not return from Weymouth till late that evening,
but of a motley band of holiday-makers from the
hill-top Inn, to discover the madman’s fate. Arriving
at the spot almost immediately after the girls’
departure, these honest revellers&mdash;strangers to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
locality&mdash;had quickly found the explanation of the
unearthly cries they had heard.</p>

<p>The eve of the baptism of Mr. Romer’s daughter
was celebrated, therefore, by the baptism of the
nameless quarry. Henceforth, in the neighbourhood
of Nevilton, the place was never known by any
other appellation than that of “Jimmy’s Drop”; and
by that name any future visitors, curious to observe
the site of so singular an occurrence, will have to
enquire for it, as they drink their pint of cider in the
Half-Moon Tavern.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smaller">A ROYAL WATERING-PLACE</span></h2>

<p>Luke Andersen’s trip to Weymouth proved
most charming and eventful. He had scarcely
emerged from the crowded station, with its
row of antique omnibuses and its lethargic phalanx
of expectant out-porters and bath-chair men,&mdash;each
one of whom was a crusted epitome of ingrained
quaintness,&mdash;when he caught sight of Phyllis Santon
and Annie Bristow strolling laughingly towards the
sea-front. They must have walked to Yeoborough
and entered the train there, for he had seen nothing
of them at Nevilton Station.</p>

<p>The vivacious Polly, a lively little curly-haired
child, of some seventeen summers, was far too happy
and thrilled by the adventure of the excursion and
the holiday air of the sea-side, to indulge in any jealous
fits. She was the first of the two, indeed, to greet
the elder girls, both of them quite well known to
her, running rapidly after them, in her white stiffly-starched
print frock, and hailing them with a shout
of joyous recognition.</p>

<p>The girls turned quickly and they all three awaited,
in perfect good temper, the stone-carver’s deliberate
approach. Never had the spirits of this latter been
higher, or his surroundings more congenial to his mood.</p>

<p>Anxious not to lose any single one of the exquisite
sounds, sights, smells, and intimations, which came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
pouring in upon him, as he leisurely drifted out upon
the sunny street, he let his little companion run after
his two friends as fast as she wished, and watched with
serene satisfaction the airy flight of her light figure,
with the deep blue patch of sea-line at the end of
the street as its welcome background.</p>

<p>The smell of sea-weed, the sound of the waves
on the beach, the cries of the fish-mongers, and the
coming and going of the whole heterogeneous crowd,
filled Luke’s senses with the same familiar thrill of
indescribable pleasure as he had known, on such an
occasion, from his earliest childhood. The gayly
piled fruit heaped up on the open stalls, the little
tobacco-shops with their windows full of half-sentimental
half-vulgar picture-cards, the weather-worn
fronts of the numerous public-houses, the wood-work
of whose hospitable doors always seemed to him
endowed with a peculiar mellowness of their own,&mdash;all
these things, as they struck his attentive senses,
revived the most deeply-felt stirrings of old associations.</p>

<p>Especially did he love the sun-bathed atmosphere,
so languid with holiday ease, which seemed to float
in and out of the open lodging-house entrances,
where hung those sun-dried sea-weeds and wooden
spades and buckets, which ever-fresh installments of
bare-legged children carried off and replaced. Luke
always maintained that of all mortal odours he loved
best the indescribable smell of the hall-way of a sea-side
lodging-house, where the very oil-cloth on the
floor, and the dead bull-rushes in the corner, seemed
impregnated with long seasons of salt-burdened sun-filled
air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span></p>

<p>The fish-shops, the green-grocer’s shops, the second-hand
book-shops, and most of all, those delicious
repositories of sea-treasures&mdash;foreign importations all
glittering with mother-of-pearl, dried sea-horses, sea-sponges,
sea-coral, and wonderful little boxes all
pasted over with shimmering shells&mdash;filled him with
a delight as vivid and new as when he had first
encountered them in remote infancy.</p>

<p>This first drifting down to the sea’s edge, after
emerging from the train, always seemed to Luke
the very supremacy of human happiness. The bare
legs of the children, little and big, who ran laughing
or crying past him and the tangled curls of the
elder damsels, tossed so coquettishly back from their
sun-burnt faces, the general feeling of irresponsibility
in the air, the tang of adventure in it all, of the unexpected,
the chance-born, always wrapped him about
in an epicurean dream of pleasure.</p>

<p>That monotonous splash of the waves against the
pebbles,&mdash;how he associated it with endless exquisite
flirtations,&mdash;flirtations conducted with adorable shamelessness
between the blue sky and the blue sea! The
memory of these, the vague memory of enchanting
forms prone or supine upon the glittering sands, with
the passing and re-passing of the same plump bathing-woman,&mdash;he
had known her since his childhood!&mdash;and
the same donkeys with their laughing
burdens, and the same sweet-sellers with their trays,
almost made him cry aloud with delight, as emerging
at length upon the Front, and overtaking his friends
at the Jubilee Clock-Tower, he saw the curved expanse
of the bay lying magically spread out before him. How
well he knew it all, and how inexpressibly he loved it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span></p>

<p>The tide was on its outward ebb when the four
happy companions jumped down, hand in hand, from
the esplanade to the shingle. The long dark windrow
of broken shells and sea-weed drew a pleasant dividing
line between the dry and the wet sand. Luke always
associated the stranded star-fish and jelly-fish and
bits of scattered drift-wood which that windrow
offered, with those other casually tossed-up treasures
with which an apparently pagan-minded providence
had bestrewn his way!</p>

<p>Once well out upon the sands, and while the girls,
with little shrieks and bursts of merriment, were
pushing one another into the reach of the tide, Luke
turned to survey with a deep sigh of satisfaction, the
general appearance of the animated scene.</p>

<p>The incomparable watering-place,&mdash;with its charming
“after-glow,” as Mr. Hardy so beautifully puts
it, “of Georgian gaiety,”&mdash;had never looked so
fascinating as it looked this August afternoon.</p>

<p>The queer old-fashioned bathing-machines, one of
them still actually carrying the Lion and Unicorn
upon its pointed roof, glittered in the sunshine with
an air of welcoming encouragement. The noble sweep
of the houses behind the crescent-shaped esplanade,
with the names of their terraces&mdash;Brunswick,
Regent, Gloucester, Adelaide&mdash;so suggestive of the
same historic epoch, gleamed with reciprocal hospitality;
nor did the tall spire of St. John’s Church, a
landmark for miles round, detract from the harmony
of the picture.</p>

<p>On Luke’s left, as he turned once more and faced
the sea, the vibrating summer air, free at present
from any trace of mist, permitted a wide and lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
view of the distant cliffs enclosing the bay. The
great White Horse, traced upon the chalk hills, seemed
within an hour’s walk of where he stood, and the
majestic promontory of the White Nore drew the
eye onward to where, at the end of the visible coast-line,
St. Alban’s Head sank into the sea.</p>

<p>On Luke’s right the immediate horizon was blocked
by the grassy eminence known to dwellers in Weymouth
as “the Nothe”; but beyond this, and beyond
the break-water which formed an extension of it,
the huge bulk of Portland&mdash;Mr. Hardy’s Isle of the
Slingers&mdash;rose massive and shadowy against the
west.</p>

<p>As he gazed with familiar pleasure at this unequalled
view, Luke could not help thinking to himself
how strangely the pervading charm of scenes of
this kind is enhanced by personal and literary association.
He recalled the opening chapters of “The
Well-Beloved,” that curiously characteristic fantasy-sketch
of the great Wessex novelist; and he also
recalled those amazing descriptions in Victor Hugo’s
“L’Homme qui Rit,” which deal with these same
localities.</p>

<p>Shouts of girlish laughter distracted him at last
from his exquisite reverie, and flinging himself down on
the hot sand he gave himself up to enjoyment. Holding
her tight by either hand, the two elder girls, their
skirts already drenched with salt-water, were dragging
their struggling companion across the foamy sea-verge.
The white surf flowed beneath their feet and
their screams and laughter rang out across the bay.</p>

<p>Luke called to them that he was going to paddle,
and implored them to do the same. He preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
to entice them thus into the deeper water, rather
than to anticipate for them a return home with
ruined petticoats and wet sand-filled shoes. Seeing
him leisurely engaged in removing his boots and socks
and turning up his trousers, the three exuberant
young people hurried back to his side and proceeded
with their own preparations.</p>

<p>Soon, all four of them, laughing and splashing one
another with water, were blissfully wading along the
shore, interspersing their playful teasing with alternate
complimentary and disparaging remarks, relative
to the various bathers whose isolation they invaded.</p>

<p>Luke’s spirits rose higher and higher. No youthful
Triton, with his attendant Nereids, could have
expressed more vividly in his radiant aplomb, the
elemental energy of air and sea. His ecstatic delight
seemed to reach its culmination as a group of extraordinarily
beautiful children came wading towards
them, their sunny hair and pearl-bright limbs gleaming
against the blue water.</p>

<p>At the supreme moment of this ecstasy, however,
came a sudden pang of contrary emotion,&mdash;of dark
fear and gloomy foreboding. For a sudden passing
second, there rose before him,&mdash;it was now about
half-past four in the afternoon,&mdash;the image of his
brother, melancholy and taciturn, his heart broken
by Lacrima’s trouble. And then, like a full dark
tide rolling in upon him, came that ominous reaction,
spoken of by the old pagan writers, and regarded by
them as the shadow of the jealousy of the Immortal
Gods, envious of human pleasure&mdash;the reaction to the
fare of the Eumenides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span></p>

<p>His companions remained as gay and charming as
ever. Nothing could have been prettier than to
watch the mixture of audacity and coyness with
which they twisted their frocks round them, nothing
more amusing than to note the differences of character
between the three, as they betrayed their naive souls
in their childish abandonment to the joy of the hour.</p>

<p>Both Phyllis and Annie were tall and slender and
dark. But there the likeness between them ceased.
Annie had red pouting lips, the lower one of which
protruded a little beyond its fellow, giving her face
in repose a quite deceptive look of sullenness and petulance.
Her features were irregular and a little heavy,
the beauty of her countenance residing in the shadowy
coils of dusky hair which surmounted it, and in the
velvet softness of her large dark eyes. For all the
heaviness of her face, Annie’s expression was one of
childlike innocence and purity; and when she flirted
or made love, she did so with a clinging affectionateness
and serious gravity which had much of the
charm of extreme youth.</p>

<p>Phyllis, on the contrary, had softly outlined features
of the most delicate regularity, while from her hazel
eyes and laughing parted lips perpetual defiant provocations
of alluring mischief challenged everyone
she approached. Annie was the more loving of the
two, Phyllis the more lively and amorous. Both of
them made constant fun of their little curly-headed
companion, whose direct boyish ways and whimsical
speeches kept them in continual peals of merriment.</p>

<p>Tired at last of paddling, they all waded to the
shore, and crossing the warm powdery sand, which is
one of the chief attractions of the place, they sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
down on the edge of the shingle and dried their feet
in the sun.</p>

<p>Reassuming their shoes and stockings, and demurely
shaking down their skirts, the three girls
followed the now rather silent Luke to the little tea-house
opposite the Clock-Tower, in an upper room of
which, looking out on the sea, were several pleasant
window-seats furnished with convenient tables.</p>

<p>The fragrant tea, the daintiness of its accessories,
the fresh taste of the bread and butter, not to speak
of the inexhaustible spirits of his companions, soon
succeeded in dispelling the stone-carver’s momentary
depression.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, as their train was not
due to leave till nearly seven, and it was now hardly
five, Luke decided to convey his little party across
the harbour-ferry. They strolled out of the shop
into the sunshine, not before the stone-carver had
bestowed so lavish a tip upon the little waitress that
his companions exchanged glances of feminine dismay.</p>

<p>They took the road through the old town to reach
the ferry, following the southern of the two parallel
streets that debouch from the Front at the point
where stands the old-fashioned equestrian statue of
George the Third. Luke nourished in his heart a
sentimental tenderness for this simple monarch,
vaguely and quite erroneously associating the royal
interest in the place with his own dreamy attachment
to it.</p>

<p>When they reached the harbour they found it in a
stir of excitement owing to the arrival of the passenger-boat
from the Channel Islands, one of the
red-funneled modern successors to those antique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
paddle-steamers whose first excursions must have
been witnessed from his Guernsey refuge by the author
of the “Toilers of the Deep.” Side by side with the
smartly painted ship, were numerous schooners and
brigs, hailing from more northern regions, whose
cargoes were being unloaded by a motley crowd of
clamorous dock-hands.</p>

<p>Luke and his three companions turned to the left
when they reached the water’s edge and strolled along
between the warehouses and the wharves until they
arrived at the massive bridge which crosses the
harbour. Leaning upon the parapet, whose whitish-grey
fabric indicated that the dominion of Leo’s
Hill gave place here to the noble Portland Stone,
they surveyed with absorbed interest the busy scene
beneath them.</p>

<p>The dark greenish-colored water swirled rapidly
seaward in the increasing ebb of the tide. White-winged
sea-gulls kept swooping down to its surface
and rising again in swift air-cutting curves, balancing
their glittering bodies against the slanting sunlight.
Every now and then a boat-load of excursionists
would shoot out from beneath the shadow of the
wharves and shipping, and cross obliquely the swift-flowing
tide to the landing steps on the further shore.</p>

<p>The four friends moved to the northern parapet of
the bridge, and the girls gave little cries of delight,
to see, at no great distance, where the broad expanse
of the back-water began to widen, a group of stately
swans, rocking serenely on the shining waves. They
remained for some while, trying to attract these
birds by flinging into the water bits of broken cake,
saved by the economic-minded Annie from the recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
repast. But these offerings only added new spoil to
the plunder of the greedy sea-gulls, from whose
rapid movements the more aristocratic inland creatures
kept haughtily aloof.</p>

<p>Preferring to use the ferry for their crossing rather
than the bridge, Luke led his friends back, along the
wharves, till they reached the line of slippery steps
about which loitered the lethargic owners of the ferry-boats.
With engaging alarm, and pretty gasps and
murmurs of half-simulated panic, the three young
damsels were helped down into one of these rough
receptacles, and the bare-necked, affable oarsman proceeded,
with ponderous leisureliness, to row them across.</p>

<p>As the heavy oars rattled in their rowlocks, and the
swirling tide gurgled about the keels, Luke, seated
in the stern, between Annie and Phyllis, felt once
more a thrilling sense of his former emotion. With
one hand round Phyllis’ waist, and the other caressing
Annie’s gloveless fingers, he permitted his gaze to
wander first up, then down, the flowing tide.</p>

<p>Far out to sea, he perceived a large war-ship, like
a great drowsy sea-monster, lying motionless between
sky and wave; and sweeping in, round the little
pier’s point, came a light full-sailed skiff, with the
water foaming across its bows.</p>

<p>With the same engaging trepidation in his country-bred
comrades, they clambered up the landing-steps,
the lower ones of which were covered with green
sea-weed, and the upper ones worn smooth as marble
by long use, and thence emerged upon the little
narrow jetty, bordering upon the harbour’s edge.</p>

<p>Here were a row of the most enchanting eighteenth
century lodging-houses, interspersed, at incredibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
frequent spaces, by small antique inns, bearing quaint
names drawn from British naval history.</p>

<p>Skirting the grassy slopes of the Nothe, with its
old-fashioned fort, they rounded the small promontory
and climbed down among the rocks and rock-pools
which lay at its feet. It was pretty to observe
the various flutterings and agitations, and to hear
the shouts of laughter and delight with which the
young girls followed Luke over these perilous and
romantic obstacles, and finally paused at his side
upon a great sun-scorched shell-covered rock, surrounded
by foamy water.</p>

<p>The wind was cool in this exposed spot, and holding
their hats in their hands the little party gave
themselves up to the freedom and freshness of air
and sea.</p>

<p>But the wandering interest of high-spirited youth
is as restless as the waves. Very soon Phyllis and
Polly had drifted away from the others, and were
climbing along the base of the cliff above, filling their
hands with sea-pinks and sea-lavender, which attracted
them by their glaucous foliage.</p>

<p>Left to themselves, Luke removed his shoes and
stockings, and dangled his feet over the rock’s edge,
while Annie, prone upon her face, the sunshine
caressing her white neck and luxuriant hair, stretched
her long bare arms into the cool water.</p>

<p>Leaning across the prostrate form of his companion,
and gazing down into the deep recesses of the tidal
pool which separated the rock they reclined on from
the one behind it, the stone-carver was able to make
out the ineffably coloured tendrils and soft translucent
shapes of several large sea-anemones, submerged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
beneath the greenish water. He pointed these out
to his companion, who moving round a little, and
tucking up her sleeves still higher, endeavoured to
reach them with her hand. In this she was defeated,
for the deceptive water was much deeper than either
of them supposed.</p>

<p>“What are those darling little shells, down there
at the bottom, Luke?” she whispered. Luke, with
his arm round her neck, and his head close to hers,
peered down into the shadowy depths.</p>

<p>“They’re some kind of cowries,” he said at last,
“shells that in Africa, I believe, they use as money.”</p>

<p>“I wish they were money here,” murmured the
girl, “I’d buy mother one of those silver brushes
we saw in the shop.”</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried Luke, and taking a penny from
his pocket he let it fall into the water. They both
fancied they heard a little metallic sound when it
struck the bottom.</p>

<p>Suddenly Annie gave a queer excited laugh, shook
herself free from her companion’s arm, and scrambled
up on her knees. Luke lay back on the rock and
gazed in wonder at her flushed cheeks and flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, child?” he enquired.</p>

<p>She fumbled at her bosom, and Luke noticed for the
first time that she was wearing round her neck a
little thin metal chain. At last with an impatient
movement of her fingers she snapped the resisting
cord and flung it into the tide. Then she held out
to Luke a small golden object, which glittered in the
palm of her hand. It was a weather-stained ring,
twisted and bent out of all shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s <em>her</em> ring!” she cried exultantly. “Crazy Bert
got it out of that hole, with a bit of bent wire, and
Phyllis squirmed it away from him by letting him
give her a lift in the wagon. He squeezed her dreadful
hard, she do say, and tickled her awful with
straws and things, but before evening she had the
ring away from him. You can bet I kissed her and
thanked her, when I got it! Us two be real friends,
as you might call it! Phyllis cried, in the night,
dreaming the idiot was pinching her, and she not
able to slap ’im back. But I got the ring, and there’t
be, Luke, glittering-gold as ever, though ’tis sad
bended and battered.”</p>

<p>Luke made a movement to take the object, but
the girl closed her fingers tightly upon it and held it
high above his head. With her arm thus raised and
the glitter of sea and sun upon her form, she resembled
some sweetly-carved figure-head on the bows of
a ship. The wind fanned her hot cheeks and caressed,
with cool touch, her splendid coils of hair. Luke was
quite overcome by her beauty, and could only stare
at her in dazed amazement, while she repeated, in
clear ringing tones, the words of the old country
game.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“My lady’s lost her golden ring;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Her golden ring, her golden ring;</div>
<div class="verse">My lady’s lost her golden ring;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I pitch upon you to find it!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The song’s refrain died away over the waves, and
was answered by the scream of an astonished cormorant,
and by a mocking shout from a group of
idle soldiers on the grassy terrace above the cliff.</p>

<p>“Shall us throw her ring out to sea?” cried Annie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
“They say a ring lost so, means sorrow for her that
owns it. Say ‘yes,’ and it’s gone, Luke!”</p>

<p>While the girl’s arm swung backwards and forwards
above him, the stone-carver’s thoughts whirled even
more rapidly through his brain. A drastic and bold
idea, that had often before crossed the threshold of
his consciousness, now assumed a most dominant
shape. Why not ask Annie to marry him?</p>

<p>He was growing a little weary of his bachelor-life.
The wayward track of his days had more than once,
of late, seemed to have reached a sort of climax.
Why not, at one reckless stroke, end this epoch of
his history, and launch out upon another? His close
association with James had hitherto stood in the way
of any such step, but his brother had fallen recently
into such fits of gloomy reticence, that he had found
himself wondering more than once whether such a
drastic troubling of the waters, as the introduction
of a girl into their ménage, would not ease the situation
a little. It was not for a moment to be supposed
that he and James could separate. If Annie
did marry him, she must do so on the understanding
of his brother’s living with them.</p>

<p>Luke began to review in his mind the various cottages
in Nevilton which might prove available for this
adventure. It tickled his fancy a great deal, the
thought of having a house and garden of his own, and
he was shrewd enough to surmise that of all his
feminine friends, Annie was by far the best fitted to
perform the functions of the good-tempered companion
of a philosophical sentimentalist. The gentle creature
had troubled him so little by jealous fits in her rôle
of sweetheart, that it did not present itself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
probable that she would prove a shrewish wife.
Glancing across the blue water to the great Rock-Island
opposite them, Luke came rapidly to the conclusion
that he would take the risk and make the
eventful plunge. He knew enough of himself to have
full confidence in his power of dealing with the delicate
art of matrimony, and the very difficulties of the
situation, implied in the number of his contemporary
amours, only added a tang and piquancy to the
enterprise.</p>

<p>“Well,” cried Annie. “Shall us throw the pretty
lady’s ring into the deep sea? It’ll mean trouble
for her, trouble and tears, Luke! Be ’ee of a mind
to do it, or be ’ee not? ’Tis your hand must fling it,
and with the flinging of it, her heart’ll drop, splash&mdash;splash&mdash;into
deep sorrow. She’ll cry her eyes
out, for this ’ere job, and that’s the truth of it,
Luke darling. Be ’ee ready to fling it, or be ’ee
not ready? There’ll be no getting it back, once us
have throwed it in.”</p>

<p>She held out her arm towards him as she spoke,
and with her other hand pushed back her hair from
her forehead. For so soft and tender a creature as
the girl was, it was strange, the wild Maenad-like
look, which she wore at that moment. She might
have been an incarnation of the avenging deities of
sea and air, threatening disaster to some unwitting
Olympian.</p>

<p>Luke scrambled to his feet, and seizing her wrist
with both his hands, forced her fingers apart, and
possessed himself of the equivocal trinket.</p>

<p>“If I throw it,” he cried, in an excited tone, “will
you be my wife, Annie?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span></p>

<p>At this unexpected word a complete collapse overtook
the girl. All trace of colour left her cheeks and
a sudden trembling passed through her limbs. She
staggered, and would have fallen, if Luke had not
seized her in his arms.</p>

<p>In the shock of saving her, the stone-carver’s hand
involuntarily unclosed, and the piece of gold, slipping
from his fingers, fell down upon the slope of the rock,
and sliding over its edge, sank into the deep water.</p>

<p>“Annie! Annie! What is it, dear?” murmured
Luke, making the trembling girl sit down by his side,
and supporting her tenderly.</p>

<p>For her only answer she flung her arms round his
neck and kissed him passionately again and again. It
was not only of kisses that Luke became conscious,
for, as she pressed him to her, her breast heaved
pitifully under her print frock, and when she let him
go, the taste of her tears was in his mouth. For the
first time in his life the queer wish entered the stone-carver’s
mind that he had not, in his day, made love
quite so often.</p>

<p>There was something so pure, so confiding, and
yet so passionately tender, about little Annie’s
abandonment, that it produced, in the epicurean
youth’s soul, a most quaint sense of shame and embarrassment.
It was deliciously sweet to him, all
the same, to find how, beyond expectation, he had
made so shrewd a choice. But he wished some
humorous demon at the back of his mind wouldn’t
call up before him at that moment the memory of
other clinging arms and lips.</p>

<p>With an inward grin of sardonic commentary upon
his melting mood, the cynical thought passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
his mind, how strange it was, in this mortal world,
that human kisses should all so lamentably resemble
one another, and that human tears should all leave
behind them the same salt taste! Life was indeed a
matter of “eternal recurrence,” and whether with
Portland and its war-ships as the background, or
with Nevilton Mount and its shady woods, the same
emotions and the same reactions must needs come
and go, with the same inexorable monotony!</p>

<p>He glanced down furtively into the foam-flecked
water, but there was no sign of the lost ring. The
tide seemed to have turned now, and the sea appeared
less calm. Little flukes of white spray surged up
intermittently on the in-rolling waves, and a strong
breath of wind, rising with the sinking of the sun,
blew cool and fresh upon their foreheads.</p>

<p>“Her ring’s gone,” whispered Annie, pulling down
her sleeves over her soft arms, and holding out her
wrists, for him to fasten the bands, “and you do
belong to none but I now, Luke. When shall us be
married, dear?” she added, pressing her cool cheek
against his, and running her fingers through his hair.</p>

<p>The words, as well as the gesture that accompanied
them, jarred upon Luke’s susceptibilities.</p>

<p>“Why is it,” he thought, “that girls are so extraordinarily
stupid in these things? Why do they
always seem only waiting for an opportunity to drop
their piquancy and provocation, and become confident,
assured, possessive, complacent? Have I,” he said to
himself, “made a horrible blunder? Shall I regret
this day forever, and be ready to give anything for
those fatal words not to have been uttered?”</p>

<p>He glanced down once more upon the brimming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
in-rushing tide that covered Gladys’ ring. Then with
a jerk he pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>“Go and call the others,” he commanded, “I’m
going to have a dip before we start.”</p>

<p>Annie glanced quickly into his face, but reassured
by his friendly smile, proceeded to obey him, with
only the least little sigh.</p>

<p>“Don’t drown yourself, dear,” she called back to
him, as she made her way cautiously across the rocks.</p>

<p>Luke hurriedly undressed, and standing for a moment,
a slim golden figure, in the horizontal sunlight,
swung himself lightly down over the rock’s edge and
struck out boldly for the open sea.</p>

<p>With vigorous strokes he wrestled with the inflowing
tide. Wave after wave splashed against his
face. Pieces of floating sea-weed and wisps of surf
clung to his arms and hair. But he held resolutely
on, breathing deep breaths of liberty and exultation,
and drinking in, as if from a vast wide-brimmed cup,
the thrilling spaciousness of air and sky.</p>

<p>Girls, love-making, marriage,&mdash;the whole complication
of the cloying erotic world,&mdash;fell away from
him, like the too-soft petals of some great stifling
velvet-bosomed flower; and naked of desire, as he was
naked of human clothes, he gave himself up to the
free, pure elements. In later hours, when once more
the old reiterated tune was beating time in his brain,
he recalled with regret the large emancipation of that
moment.</p>

<p>As he splashed and spluttered, and turned over
deliciously in the water, like some exultant human-limbed
merman, returning, after a long inland exile,
to his natural home, he found his thoughts fantastically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
reverting to those queer, mad ideas, about the
evil power of the stone they both worked upon, to
which James Andersen had given expression when his
wits were astray. Here at any rate, in the solid
earth’s eternal antagonist, was a power capable of
destroying every sinister spell.</p>

<p>He remorsefully blamed himself that he had not
compelled his brother to come down with them to
the sea. He recalled the half-hearted invitation he
had extended to James, not altogether sorry to have
it refused, and not repeating it. He had been a selfish
fool, he thought. Were James swimming now by his
side, his pleasure in that violet-coloured coast-line and
that titanic rock-monster, would have been doubled
by the revival of indescribably appealing memories.</p>

<p>He made a vigorous resolution that never again&mdash;whatever
mood his brother might be in&mdash;would he
allow the perilous lure of exquisite femininity, to come
between him and the nobler classic bond, of the
love that “passeth the love of women.”</p>

<p>Conscious that he must return without a moment’s
further delay if they were to catch their train, he
swung round in the water and let the full tide bear
him shoreward.</p>

<p>On the way back he was momentarily assailed by
a slight touch of cramp in his legs. It quickly
passed, but it was enough to give the life-enamoured
youth a shock of cold panic. Death? <em>That</em>, after
all, he thought, was the only intolerable thing. As
long as one breathed and moved, in this mad world,
nothing that could happen greatly mattered! One
was conscious,&mdash;one could note the acts and scenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
of the incredible drama; and in this mere fact of
consciousness, one could endure anything. But to be
dead,&mdash;to be deprived of the sweet air,&mdash;that
remained, that must always remain, the one absolute
Terror!</p>

<p>Reaching his starting-place, Luke was amused to
observe that the tide was already splashing over
their rock, and in another minute or two would have
drenched his clothes. He chuckled to himself as he
noted how this very practical possibility jerked his
mind into a completely different vein. Love, philosophy,
friendship, all tend to recede to the very depths
of one’s invaluable consciousness, when there appears
a risk of returning to a railway station in a drenched
shirt.</p>

<p>He collected his possessions with extreme rapidity,
and holding them in a bundle at arm’s length from
his dripping body, clambered hastily up the shore,
and humorously waving back his modest companions,
who were now being chaffed by quite a considerable
group of soldiers on the cliff above, he settled himself
down on a bank of sea-weed and began hurriedly to
dry, using his waistcoat as a towel.</p>

<p>He was soon completely dressed, and, all four of
them a little agitated, began a hasty rush for the
train.</p>

<p>Phyllis and Polly scolded him all the way without
mercy. Had he brought them out here, to keep them
in the place all night? What would their mothers
say, and their fathers, and their brothers, and their
aunts?</p>

<p>Annie, alone of the party, remained silent, her full
rich lips closed like a sleepy peony, and her heavy-lidded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
velvety eyes casting little timid affectionate
glances at her so unexpectedly committed lover.</p>

<p>The crossness of the two younger girls grew in
intensity when, the ferry safely crossed, Luke dragged
them at remorseless speed through the crowded town.
Pitiful longing eyes were cast back at the glittering
shops and the magical picture-shows. Why had he
taken them to those horrid rocks? Why hadn’t he
given them time to look at the shop-windows?
They’d promised faithfully to bring back something
for Dad and Betty and Queenie and Dick.</p>

<p>Phyllis had ostentatiously flung into the harbour
her elaborately selected bunch of sea-flora, and the
poor ill-used plants, hot from the girl’s hand, were
now tossing up and down amid the tarry keels and
swaying hawsers. The girl regretted this action
now,&mdash;regretted it more and more vividly as the
station drew near. Mummy always loved a bunch
o’ flowers, and they were so pretty! She was sure it
was Luke who had made her lose them. He had
pushed her so roughly up those nasty steps.</p>

<p>Tears were in Polly’s eyes as, bedraggled and
panting, they emerged on the open square where the
gentle monarch looks down from his stone horse.
There were sailors now, mixed with the crowd on the
esplanade,&mdash;such handsome boys! It was cruel, it
was wicked, that they had to go, just when the real
sport began.</p>

<p>The wretched Jubilee Clock&mdash;how they all hated
its trim appearance!&mdash;had a merciless finger pointing
at the very minute their train was due to start, as
Luke hurried them round the street-corner. Polly
fairly began to cry, as they dragged her from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
alluring scene. She was certain that the Funny Men
were just going to begin. She was sure that that
distant drum meant Punch and Judy!</p>

<p>Breathlessly they rushed upon the platform.
Wildly, with anxious eyes and gasping tones, they
enquired of the first official they encountered, whether
the Yeoborough train had gone.</p>

<p>Observing the beauty of the three troubled girls,
this placid authority proceeded to tantalize them,
asking “what the hurry was,” and whether they
wanted a “special,” and other maddening questions.
It was only when Luke, who had rushed furiously to
the platform’s remote end, was observed to be cheerfully
and serenely returning, that Phyllis recovered
herself sufficiently to give their disconcerted insulter
what she afterwards referred to as “a bit of lip in
return for his blarsted sauce.”</p>

<p>No,&mdash;the train would not be starting for another
ten minutes. Fortunate indeed was this accident of
a chance delay on the Great Western Railroad,&mdash;the
most punctual of all railroads in the world,&mdash;for it
landed Luke with three happy, completely recovered
damsels, and in a compartment all to themselves,
when the train did move at last. Abundantly
fortified with ginger-pop and sponge-cake,&mdash;how
closely Luke associated the savour of both these
refreshments with such an excursion as this!&mdash;and
further cheered by the secure possession of chocolates,
bananas, “Ally Sloper’s Half Holiday,” and the “Illustrated
London News,”&mdash;the girls romped, and sang,
and teased each other and Luke, and whispered
endearing mockeries out of the window to sedately
unconscious gentlemen, at every station where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
stopped until the aged guard’s paternal benevolence
changed to irritable crossness, and Luke himself was
not altogether sorry when the familiar landscape of
Yeoborough, dusky and shadowy in the twilight,
hove in sight.</p>

<p>Little Polly left them at the second of the two
Yeoborough stations, and the others, crowding at
the window to wave their good-byes, were carried on
in the same train to Nevilton.</p>

<p>During this final five minutes, Annie slipped softly
down upon her lover’s knees and seemed to wish to
indicate to Phyllis, without the use of words, that her
relations with their common friend were now on a
new plane,&mdash;at once more innocent and less reserved.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="smaller">AVE ATQUE VALE!</span></h2>

<p>James Andersen lay dead in the brothers’
little bedroom at the station-master’s cottage.
It could not be maintained that his face wore the
unruffled calm conventionally attributed to mortality’s
last repose. On the other hand, his expression was not
that of one who has gone down in hopeless despair.</p>

<p>What his look really conveyed to his grief-worn
brother, as he hung over him all that August night,
was the feeling that he had been struck in mid-contest,
with equal chance of victory or defeat, and
with the indelible imprint upon his visage of the stress
and strain of the terrific struggle.</p>

<p>It was a long and strange vigil that Luke found
himself thus bound to keep, when the first paroxysm
of his grief had subsided and his sympathetic landlady
had left him alone with his dead.</p>

<p>He laughed aloud,&mdash;a merciless little laugh,&mdash;at
one point in the night, to note how even this blow,
rending as it did the very ground beneath his feet,
had yet left quite untouched and untamed his irresistible
instinct towards self-analysis. Not a single
one of the innumerable, and in many cases astounding,
thoughts that passed through his mind, but he
watched it, and isolated it, and played with it,&mdash;just
in the old way.</p>

<p>Luke was not by any means struck dumb or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
paralyzed by this event. His intelligence had never
been more acute, or his senses more responsive, than
they remained through those long hours of watching.</p>

<p>It is true he could neither eat nor sleep. The influence
of the motionless figure beside him seemed to
lie in a vivid and abnormal stimulation of all his
intellectual faculties.</p>

<p>Not a sound arose from the sleeping house, from
the darkened fields, from the distant village, but he
noted it and made a mental record of its cause. He
kept two candles alight at his brother’s head, three
times refilling the candlesticks, as though the guttering
and hissing of the dwindling flames would tease
and disturb the dead.</p>

<p>He had been careful to push the two windows of
the room wide open; but the night was so still that
not a breath of wind entered to make the candles
flicker, or to lift the edge of the white sheet stretched
beneath his brother’s bandaged chin. This horrible
bandage,&mdash;one of the little incidents that Luke
marked as unexpectedly ghastly,&mdash;seemed to slip its
knot at a certain moment, causing the dead man’s
mouth to fall open, in a manner that made the
watcher shudder, so suggestive did it seem of one
about to utter a cry for help.</p>

<p>Luke noted, as another factor in the phenomena of
death, the peculiar nature of the coldness of his
brother’s skin, as he bent down once and again to
touch his forehead. It was different from the coldness
of water or ice or marble. It was a clammy coldness;
the coldness of a substance that was neither&mdash;in the
words of the children’s game&mdash;“animal, vegetable,
nor mineral.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span></p>

<p>Luke remembered the story of that play of Webster’s,
in which the unhappy heroine, in the blank
darkness of her dungeon, is presented with a dead
hand to caress. The abominably wicked wish crossed
his mind once, as he unclosed those stark fingers, that
he could cause the gentle Lacrima, whom he regarded,&mdash;not
altogether fairly,&mdash;as responsible for his
brother’s death, to feel the touch of such a hand.</p>

<p>There came over him, at other times, as he inhaled
the cool, hushed air from the slumbering fields, and
surveyed the great regal planet,&mdash;Mr. Romer’s star,
he thought grimly,&mdash;as it hung so formidably close
to the silvery pallid moon, a queer dreamy feeling
that the whole thing were a scene in a play or a
story, absolutely unreal; and that he would only
have to rouse himself and shake off the unnatural
spell, to have his brother with him again, alive and in
full consciousness.</p>

<p>The odd thing about it was that he found himself
refusing to believe that this was his brother at all,&mdash;this
mask beneath the white sheet,&mdash;and even
fancying that at any moment the familiar voice
might call to him from the garden, and he have to
descend to unlock the door.</p>

<p>That thought of his brother’s voice sent a pang
through him of sick misgiving. Surely it couldn’t
be possible, that never, not through the whole of
eternity, would he hear that voice again?</p>

<p>He moved to the window and listened. Owls were
hooting somewhere up at Wild Pine, and from the
pastures towards Hullaway came the harsh cry of a
night-jar.</p>

<p>He gazed up at the glittering heavens, sprinkled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
with those proud constellations whose identity it was
one of his pastimes to recognize. How little they
cared! How appallingly little they cared! What a
farce, what an obscene, unpardonable farce, the whole
business was!</p>

<p>He caught the sound of an angry bark in some
distant yard.</p>

<p>Luke cursed the irrelevant intrusive noise. “Ah!
thou vile Larva!” he muttered. “What! Shall a dog,
a cat, a rat, have life; and thou no breath at all?”</p>

<p>He leant far out of the window, breathing the
perfumes of the night. He noticed, as an interesting
fact, that it was neither the phloxes nor the late roses
whose scent filled the air, but that new exotic tobacco-plant,&mdash;a
thing whose sticky, quickly-fading, trumpet-shaped
petals were one of his brother’s especial
aversions.</p>

<p>The immense spaces of the night, as they carried
his gaze onward from one vast translunar sign to
another, filled him with a strange feeling of the
utter unimportance of any earthly event. The
Mythology of Power and the Mythology of Sacrifice
might wrestle in desperate contention for the mastery;
but what mattered, in view of this great dome which
overshadowed them, the victory or the defeat of
either? Mythologies were they both; both woven
out of the stuff of dreams, and both vanishing like
dreams, in the presence of this stark image upon the
bed!</p>

<p>He returned to his brother’s side, and rocked himself
up and down on his creaking bedroom chair.
“Dead and gone!” he muttered, “dead and gone!”</p>

<p>It was easy to deal in vague mystic speculation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
But what relief could he derive, he who wanted his
brother back as he was, with his actual tones, and
ways and looks, from any problematic chance that
some thin “spiritual principle,” or ideal wraith, of the
man were now wandering through remote, unearthly
regions? The darling of his soul&mdash;the heart of his
heart&mdash;had become forever this appalling waxen
image, this thing that weighed upon him with its
presence!</p>

<p>Luke bent over the dead man. What a personality,
what a dominant and oppressive personality, a corpse
has! It is not the personality of the living man, but
another&mdash;a quite different one&mdash;masquerading in
his place.</p>

<p>Luke felt almost sure that this husk, this shell,
this mockery of the real James, was possessed of some
detestable consciousness of its own, a consciousness
as remote from that of the man he loved as that
pallid forehead with the deep purple gash across it,
was remote from the dear head whose form he knew
so well. How crafty, how malignant, a corpse was!</p>

<p>He returned to his uncomfortable chair and pondered
upon what this loss meant to him. It was
like the burying alive of half his being. How could
he have thoughts, sensations, feelings, fancies; how
could he have loves and hates, without James to tell
them to? A cold sick terror of life passed through
him, of life without this companion of his soul. He
felt like a child lost in some great forest.</p>

<p>“Daddy James! Daddy James!” he cried, “I want
you;&mdash;I want you!”</p>

<p>He found himself repeating this infantile conjuration
over and over again. He battered with clenched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
hand upon the adamantine wall of silence. But there
was neither sign nor voice nor token nor “any that
regarded.” There was only the beating of his own
heart and the ticking of the watch upon the table.
And all the while, with its malignant cunning, the
corpse regarded him, mute, derisive, contemptuous.</p>

<p>He thought, lightly and casually, as one who at the
grave of all he loves plucks a handful of flowers, of
the girls he had just parted from, and of Gladys and
all his other infatuations. How impossible it seemed
to him that a woman&mdash;a girl&mdash;that any one of
these charming, distracting creatures&mdash;should strike
a man down by their loss, as he was now stricken
down.</p>

<p>He tried to imagine what he would feel if it were
Annie lying there, under the sheet, in place of James.
He would be sorry; he would be bitterly sad; he would
be angry with the callous heavens; but as long as
James were near, as long as James were by his side,&mdash;his
life would still be his life. He would suffer, and
the piteous tragedy of the thing would smite and
sicken him; but it would not be the same. It would
not be like this!</p>

<p>What was there in the love of a man that made
the loss of it&mdash;for him at least&mdash;so different a
thing? Was it that with women, however much one
loved them, there was something equivocal, evasive,
intangible; something made up of illusion and
sorcery, of magic and moonbeams; that since it could
never be grasped as firmly as the other, could never
be as missed as the other, when the grasp had to
relax? Or was it that, for all their clear heads,&mdash;heads
so much clearer than poor James’!&mdash;and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
all their spiritual purity,&mdash;there was lacking in
them a certain indescribable mellowness of sympathy,
a certain imaginative generosity and tolerance, which
meant the true secret of the life lived in common?</p>

<p>From the thought of his girls, Luke’s mind wandered
back to the thought of what the constant
presence of his brother as a background to his life
had really meant. Even as he sat there, gazing so
hopelessly at the image on the bed, he found himself
on the point of resolving to explain all these matters
to James and hear his opinion upon them.</p>

<p>By degrees, as the dawn approached, the two
blank holes into cavernous darkness which the
windows of the chamber had become, changed their
character. A faint whitish-blue transparency grew
visible within their enclosing frames, and something
ghostly and phantom-like, the stealthy invasion of a
new presence, glided into the room.</p>

<p>This palpable presence, the frail embryo of a new
day, gave to the yellow candle-flames a queer sickly
pallor and intensified to a chalky opacity the dead
whiteness of the sheet, and of the folded hands
resting upon it. It was with the sound of the first
twittering birds, and the first cock-crow, that the ice-cold
spear of desolation pierced deepest of all into
Luke’s heart. He shivered, and blew out the candles.</p>

<p>A curious feeling possessed him that, in a sudden
ghastly withdrawal, that other James, the James he
had been turning to all night in tacit familiar appeal,
had receded far out of his reach. From indistinct
horizons his muffled voice moaned for a while, like
the wind in the willows of Lethe, and then died away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
in a thin long-drawn whisper. Luke was alone;
alone with his loss and alone with the image of
death.</p>

<p>He moved to the window and looked out. Streaks
of watery gold were already visible above the eastern
uplands, and a filmy sea of white mist swayed and
fluttered over the fields.</p>

<p>All these things together, the white mist, the white
walls of the room, the white light, the white covering
on the body, seemed to fall upon the worn-out
watcher with a weight of irresistible finality. James
was dead&mdash;“gone to his death-bed;&mdash;he never
would come again!”</p>

<p>Turning his back wearily upon those golden sky-streaks,
that on any other occasion would have
thrilled him with their magical promise, Luke observed
the dead bodies of no less than five large moths
grouped around the extinct candles. Two of them
were “currant-moths,” one a “yellow under-wing,” and
the others beyond his entomological knowledge.
This was the only holocaust, then, allowed to the
dead man. Five moths! And the Milky Way had
looked down upon their destruction with the same
placidity as upon the cause of the vigil that slew
them.</p>

<p>Luke felt a sudden desire to escape from this room,
every object of which bore now, in dimly obscure
letters, the appalling handwriting of the ministers of
fate. He crept on tiptoe to the door and opened it
stealthily. Making a mute valedictory gesture towards
the bed, he shut the door behind him and slipped
down the little creaking stairs.</p>

<p>He entered his landlady’s kitchen, and as silently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
as he could collected a bundle of sticks and lit the
fire. The crackling flames produced an infinitesimal
lifting of the cloud which weighed upon his spirit.
He warmed his hands before the blaze. From some
remote depth within him, there began to awake once
more the old inexpugnable zest for life.</p>

<p>Piling some pieces of coal upon the burning wood
and drawing the kettle to the edge of the hob, he left
the kitchen; and crossing the little hall, impregnated
with a thin sickly odor of lamp-oil, he shot back the
bolts of the house-door, and let himself out into the
morning air.</p>

<p>A flock of starlings fluttered away over the meadow,
and from the mist-wreathed recesses of Nevilton
House gardens came the weird defiant scream of a
peacock.</p>

<p>He glanced furtively, as if such a glance were
almost sacrilegious, at the open windows of his
brother’s room; and then pushing open the garden-gate
emerged into the dew-drenched field. He could
not bring himself to leave the neighbourhood of the
house, but began pacing up and down the length of
the meadow, from the hedge adjacent to the railway,
to that elm-shadowed corner, where not so many
weeks ago he had distracted himself with Annie and
Phyllis. He continued this reiterated pacing,&mdash;his
tired brain giving itself up to the monotony of a
heart-easing movement,&mdash;until the sun had risen
quite high above the horizon. The great fiery orb
pleased him well, in its strong indifference, as with its
lavish beams it dissipated the mist and touched the
tree-trunks with ruddy colour.</p>

<p>“Ha!” he cried aloud, “the sun is the only God!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
To the sun must all flesh turn, if it would live and
not die!”</p>

<p>Half ashamed of this revival of his spirits he obeyed
the beckoning gestures of the station-master’s wife,
who now appeared at the door.</p>

<p>The good woman’s sympathy, though not of the
silent or tactful order, was well adapted to prevent
the immediate return of any hopeless grief.</p>

<p>“’Tis good it were a Saturday when the Lord took
him,” she said, pouring out for her lodger a steaming
cup of excellent tea, and buttering a slice of bread;
“he’ll have Sunday to lie up in. It be best of all
luck for these poor stiff ones, to have church bells
rung over ’em.”</p>

<p>“I pray Heaven I shan’t have any visitors today,”
remarked Luke, sipping his tea and stretching out his
feet to the friendly blaze.</p>

<p>“That ye’ll be sure to have!” answered the woman;
“and the sooner ye puts on a decent black coat, and
washes and brushes up a bit, the better ’twill be for
all concerned. I always tells my old man that when
he do fall stiff, like what your brother be, I shall put
on my black silk gown and sit in the front parlour
with a bottle of elder wine, ready for all sorts and
conditions.”</p>

<p>Luke rose, with a piece of bread-and-butter in his
hand, and surveyed himself in the mirror.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do need a bit of tidying,” he said. “Perhaps
you wouldn’t mind my shaving down here?”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the young stone-carver could not
help recalling those sinister stories of dead men whose
beards have grown in their coffins. The landlady
nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll make ’ee up a bed for these ’ere days,” she
said, “in Betty’s room. As for shaving and such like,
please yourself, Master Luke. This house be thy
house with him lying up there.”</p>

<p>Between nine and ten o’clock Luke’s first visitor
made his appearance. This was Mr. Clavering, who
showed himself neither surprised nor greatly pleased
to find the bereft brother romping with the children
under the station-master’s apple-trees.</p>

<p>“I cannot express to you the sympathy I feel,”
said the clergyman, “with your grief under this
great blow. Words on these occasions are of little
avail. But I trust you know where to turn for true
consolation.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” replied Luke, who, though carefully
shaved and washed, still wore the light grey
flannel suit of his Saturday’s excursion.</p>

<p>“Give Mr. Clavering an apple, Lizzie!” he added.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t for a moment,” continued the Reverend
Hugh, “intrude upon you with any impertinent
questions. But I could not help wondering as I
walked through the village how this tragedy would
affect you. I prayed it might,”&mdash;here he laid a
grave and pastoral hand on the young man’s arm,&mdash;“I
prayed it might give you a different attitude to
those high matters which we have at various times
discussed together. Am I right in my hope, Luke?”</p>

<p>Never had the superb tactlessness of Nevilton’s
vicar betrayed him more deplorably.</p>

<p>“Death is death, Mr. Clavering,” replied the
stone-carver, lifting up the youngest of the children
and placing her astride on an apple-branch. “It’s
about the worst blow fate’s ever dealt me. But when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
it comes to any change in my ideas,&mdash;no! I can’t
say that I’ve altered.”</p>

<p>“I understand you weren’t with him when this
terrible thing happened,” said the clergyman. “They
tell me he was picked up by strangers. There’ll be
no need, I trust, for an inquest, or anything of that
kind?”</p>

<p>Luke shook his head. “The doctor was up here
last night. The thing’s clear enough. His mind
must have given way again. He’s had those curst
quarries on his nerves for a long while past. I wish
to the devil&mdash;I beg your pardon, sir!&mdash;I wish I’d
taken him to Weymouth with me. I was a fool not
to insist on that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard you were away,” remarked Hugh,
with a certain caustic significance in his tone. “One
or two of our young friends were with you, I believe?”</p>

<p>Luke did not fail to miss the implication, and he hit
back vindictively.</p>

<p>“I understand you’ve had an interesting little service
this morning, sir, or perhaps it’s yet to come off?
I can’t help being a bit amused when I think of it!”</p>

<p>An electric shock of anger thrilled through Clavering’s
frame. Controlling himself with a heroic effort,
he repelled the malignant taunt.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you concerned yourself with these
observances, Andersen,” he remarked. “But you’re
quite right. I’ve just this minute come from receiving
Miss Romer into our church. Miss Traffio was with
her. Both young ladies were greatly agitated over
this unhappy occurrence. In fact it cast quite a
gloom over what otherwise is one of the most beautiful
incidents of all, in our ancient ritual.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span></p>

<p>Luke swung the little girl on the bough backwards
and forwards. The other children, retired to a
discreet distance, stared at the colloquy with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p>“This baptizing of adults,” continued Luke,&mdash;“you
call ’em adults, don’t you, on these occasions?&mdash;is
really a little funny, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Funny!” roared the angry priest. “No, sir, it
isn’t funny! The saving of an immortal soul by
God’s most sacred sacrament may not appeal to you
infidels as an essential ceremony,&mdash;but only a thoroughly
vulgar and philistine mind could call it
funny!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we shall never agree on these topics,
Mr. Clavering,” replied Luke calmly. “But it was
most kind of you to come up and see me. I really
appreciate it. Would it be possible,”&mdash;his voice
took a lower and graver tone,&mdash;“for my brother’s
funeral to be performed on Wednesday? I should be
very grateful to you, sir, if that could be arranged.”</p>

<p>The young vicar frowned and looked slightly
disconcerted. “What time would you wish it to be,
Andersen?” he enquired. “I ask you this, because
Wednesday is&mdash;er&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;the date fixed
for another of these ceremonies that you scoff at.
The Lord Bishop comes to Nevilton then. It is his
own wish. I should myself have preferred a later
date.”</p>

<p>“Ha! the confirmation!” ejaculated Luke, with a
bitter little laugh. “You’re certainly bent on striking
while the iron’s hot, Mr. Clavering. May I ask what
hour has been fixed for <em>this</em> beautiful ceremony?”</p>

<p>“Eleven o’clock in the morning,” replied the priest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
ignoring with a dignified wave of his hand the stone-carver’s
jeering taunt.</p>

<p>“Well then&mdash;if that suits you&mdash;and does not
interfere with the Lord Bishop&mdash;” said Luke, “I
should be most grateful if you could make the hour
for James’ funeral, ten o’clock in the morning? <em>That</em>
service I happen to be more familiar with than the
others,&mdash;and I know it doesn’t take very long.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clavering bent his head in assent.</p>

<p>“It shall certainly be as you wish,” he said. “If
unforeseen difficulties arise, I will let you know. But
I have no doubt it can be managed.</p>

<p>“I am right in assuming,” he added, a little uneasily,
“that your brother was a baptized member of
our church?”</p>

<p>Luke lifted the child from the bough and made her
run off to play with the others. The glance he then
turned upon the vicar of Nevilton was not one of
admiration.</p>

<p>“James was the noblest spirit I’ve ever known,”
he said sternly. “If there is such a thing as another
world, he is certain to reach it&mdash;church or no
church. As a matter of fact, if it is at all important
to you, he was baptized in Nevilton. You’ll find his
name in the register&mdash;and mine too!” he added with
a laugh.</p>

<p>Mr. Clavering kept silence, and moved towards the
gate. Luke followed him, and at the gate they shook
hands. Perhaps the same thought passed through
the minds of both of them, as they went through this
ceremony; for a very queer look, almost identical in
its expression on either face, was exchanged between
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the morning was over Luke had a second
visit of condolence. This was from Mr. Quincunx,
and never had the quaint recluse been more warmly
received. Luke was conscious at once that here was
a man who could enter into every one of his feelings,
and be neither horrified nor scandalized by the most
fantastic inconsistency.</p>

<p>The two friends walked up and down the sunny
field in front of the house, Luke pouring into the
solitary’s attentive ears every one of his recent impressions
and sensations.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx was evidently profoundly moved by
James’ death. He refused Luke’s offer to let him
visit the room upstairs, but his refusal was expressed
in such a natural and characteristic manner that the
stone-carver accepted it in perfect good part.</p>

<p>After a while they sat down together under the
shady hedge at the top of the meadow. Here they
discoursed and philosophized at large, listening to the
sound of the church-bells and watching the slow-moving
cattle. It was one of those unruffled Sunday
mornings, when, in such places as this, the drowsiness
of the sun-warmed leaves and grasses seems endowed
with a kind of consecrated calm, the movements of
the horses and oxen grow solemn and ritualistic, the
languor of the heavy-winged butterflies appears holy,
and the stiff sabbatical dresses of the men and women
who shuffle so demurely to and fro, seem part of a
patient liturgical observance.</p>

<p>Luke loved Mr. Quincunx that morning. The
recluse was indeed precisely in his element. Living
habitually himself in thoughts of death, pleased&mdash;in
that incomparable sunshine&mdash;to find himself still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
alive, cynical and yet considerate, mystical and yet
humorous, he exactly supplied what the wounded
heart of the pagan mourner required for its comfort.</p>

<p>“Idiots! asses! fools!” the stone-carver ejaculated,
apostrophizing in his inmost spirit the various persons,
clever or otherwise, to whom this nervous and eccentric
creature was a mere type of failure and superannuation.
None of these others,&mdash;not one of them,&mdash;not
Romer nor Dangelis nor Clavering nor Taxater&mdash;could
for a moment have entered into the peculiar
feelings which oppressed him. As for Gladys or
Phyllis or Annie or Polly,&mdash;he would have as soon
thought of relating his emotions to a row of swallows
upon a telegraph-wire as to any of those dainty
epitomes of life’s evasiveness!</p>

<p>A man’s brain, a man’s imagination, a man’s
scepticism, was what he wanted; but he wanted it
touched with just that flavour of fanciful sentiment of
which the Nevilton hermit was a master. A hundred
quaint little episodes, the import of which none but
Mr. Quincunx could have appreciated, were evoked
by the stone-carver. Nothing was too blasphemous,
nothing too outrageous, nothing too bizarre, for the
solitary’s taste. On the other hand, he entered with
tender and perfect clairvoyance into the sick misery
of loss which remained the background of all Luke’s
sensations.</p>

<p>The younger man’s impetuous confidences ebbed
and dwindled at last; and with the silence of the
church-bells and the receding to the opposite corner
of the field of the browsing cattle, a deep and melancholy
hush settled upon them both.</p>

<p>Then it was that Mr. Quincunx began speaking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span>
himself and his own anxieties. In the tension of the
moment he even went so far as to disclose to Luke,
under a promise of absolute secrecy, the sinister story
of that contract into which Lacrima had entered with
their employer.</p>

<p>Luke was all attention at once. This was indeed a
piece of astounding news! He couldn’t have said
whether he wondered more at the quixotic devotion
of Lacrima for this quaint person, or at the solitary’s
unprecedented candour in putting him “en rapport”
with such an amazing situation.</p>

<p>“Of course we know,” murmured Mr. Quincunx,
in his deep subterranean voice, “that she wouldn’t
have promised such a thing, unless in her heart she
had been keen, at all costs, to escape from those
people. It isn’t human nature to give up everything
for nothing. Probably, as a matter of fact, she
rather likes the idea of having a house of her own.
I expect she thinks she could twist that fool Goring
round her finger; and I daresay she could! But the
thing is, what do you advise <em>me</em> to do? Of course I’m
glad enough to agree to anything that saves me from
this damnable office. But what worries me about it
is that devil Romer put it into her head. I don’t
trust him, Luke; I don’t trust him!”</p>

<p>“I should think you don’t!” exclaimed his companion,
looking with astonishment and wonder into
the solemn grey eyes fixed sorrowfully and intently
upon his own. What a strange thing, he thought to
himself, that this subtle-minded intelligence should be
so hopelessly devoid of the least push of practical
impetus.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Mr. Quincunx continued, “neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
you nor I would fuss ourselves much over the idea of a
girl being married to a fool like this, if there weren’t
something different from the rest about her. This
nonsense about their having to ‘love,’ as the little
simpletons call it, the man they agree to live with, is
of course all tommy-rot. No one ‘loves’ the person
they live with. She wouldn’t love me,&mdash;she’d
probably hate me like poison,&mdash;after the first week
or so! The romantic idiots who make so much of
‘love,’ and are so horrified when these little creatures
are married without it, don’t understand what this
planet is made of. They don’t understand the feelings
of the girls either.</p>

<p>“I tell you a girl <em>likes</em> being made a victim of in this
particular kind of way. They’re much less fastidious,
when it comes to the point, than we are. As a matter
of fact what does trouble them is being married to a
man they really have a passion for. Then, jealousy
bites through their soft flesh like Cleopatra’s serpent,
and all sorts of wild ideas get into their heads. It’s
not natural, Luke, it’s not natural, for girls to marry
a person they love! That’s why we country dogs
treat the whole thing as a lewd jest.</p>

<p>“Do you think these honest couples who stand
giggling and smirking before our dear clergyman every
quarter, don’t hate one another in their hearts? Of
course they do; it wouldn’t be nature if they didn’t!
But that doesn’t say they don’t get their pleasure
out of it. And Lacrima’ll get her pleasure, in some
mad roundabout fashion, from marrying Goring,&mdash;you
may take my word for that!”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” remarked Luke slowly, “that
you’re trying all this time to quiet your conscience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
I believe you’ve really got far more conscience,
Maurice, than I have. It’s your conscience that
makes you speak so loud, at this very moment!”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx got up on his feet and stroked his
beard. “I’m afraid I’ve annoyed you somehow,” he
remarked. “No person ever speaks of another person’s
conscience unless he’s in a rage with him.”</p>

<p>The stone-carver stretched out his legs and lit a
cigarette. “Sit down again, you old fool,” he said,
“and let’s talk this business over sensibly.”</p>

<p>The recluse sighed deeply, and, subsiding into his
former position, fixed a look of hopeless melancholy
upon the sunlit landscape.</p>

<p>“The point is this, Maurice,” began the young
man. “The first thing in these complicated situations
is to be absolutely certain what one wants oneself.
It seems to me that a good deal of your agitation
comes from the fact that you haven’t made up your
mind what you want. You asked my advice, you
know, so you won’t be angry if I’m quite plain with
you?”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Mr. Quincunx, a remote flicker of
his goblin-smile twitching his nostrils, “I see I’m in
for a few little hits.”</p>

<p>Luke waved his hand. “No hits, my friend, no
hits. All I want to do, is to find out from you what
you really feel. One philosophizes, naturally, about
girls marrying, and so on; but the point is,&mdash;do you
want this particular young lady for yourself, or don’t
you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx stroked his beard. “Well,”&mdash;he
said meditatively, “if it comes to that, I suppose I do
want her. We’re all fools in some way or other, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
fancy. Yes, I do want her, Luke, and that’s the
honest truth. But I don’t want to have to work
twice as hard as I’m doing now, and under still more
unpleasant conditions, to keep her!”</p>

<p>Luke emitted a puff of smoke and knocked the
ashes from his cigarette upon the purple head of a
tall knapweed.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he ejaculated. “Now we’ve got something
to go upon.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx surveyed the faun-like profile of
his friend with some apprehension. He mentally
resolved that nothing,&mdash;nothing in heaven nor
earth,&mdash;should put him to the agitation of making
any drastic change in his life.</p>

<p>“We get back then,” continued Luke, “to the
point we reached on our walk to Seven Ashes.”</p>

<p>As he said the words “Seven Ashes” the ice-cold
finger of memory pierced him with that sudden stab
which is like a physical blow. What did it matter,
after all, he thought, what happened to any of these
people, now Daddy James was dead?</p>

<p>“You remember,” he went on, while the sorrowful
grey eyes of his companion regarded him with wistful
anxiety, “you told me, in that walk, that if some
imaginary person were to leave you money enough
to live comfortably, you would marry Lacrima without
any hesitation?”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx nodded.</p>

<p>“Well,”&mdash;Luke continued&mdash;“in return for your
confession about that contract, I’ll confess to you
that Mr. Taxater and I formed a plan together, when
my brother first got ill, to secure you this money.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx made a grimace of astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span></p>

<p>“The plan has lapsed now,” went on Luke, “owing
to Mr. Taxater’s being away; but I can’t help feeling
that something of that kind might be done. I feel
in a queer sort of fashion,” he added, “though I can’t
quite tell you why, that, after all, things’ll so work
themselves out, that you <em>will</em> get both the girl and
the money!”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx burst into a fit of hilarious merriment,
and rubbed his hands together. But a moment
later his face clouded.</p>

<p>“It’s impossible,” he murmured with a deep sigh;
“it’s impossible, Luke. Girls and gold go together
like butterflies and sunshine. I’m as far from either,
as the sea-weed under the arch of Weymouth Bridge.”</p>

<p>Luke pondered for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>“It’s an absurd superstition,” he finally remarked,
“but I can’t help a sort of feeling that James’ spirit
is actively exerting itself on your side. He was
a romantic old truepenny, and his last thoughts were
all fixed&mdash;of that I’m sure&mdash;upon Lacrima’s
escaping this marriage with Goring.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx sighed. He had vaguely imagined
the possibility of some grand diplomatic stroke on his
behalf, from the astute Luke; and this relapse into
mysticism, on the part of that sworn materialist, did
not strike him as reassuring.</p>

<p>The silence that fell between them was broken by
the sudden appearance of a figure familiar to them
both, crossing the field towards them. It was Witch-Bessie,
who, in a bright new shawl, and with a mysterious
packet clutched in her hand, was beckoning to
attract their attention. The men rose and advanced
to meet her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll sit down a bit with ’ee,” cried the old woman,
waving to them to return to their former position.</p>

<p>When they were seated once more beneath the
bank,&mdash;the old lady, like some strange Peruvian
idol, resting cross-legged at their feet,&mdash;she began,
without further delay, to explain the cause of her
visit.</p>

<p>“I know’d how ’twould be with ’ee,” she said,
addressing Luke, but turning a not unfriendly eye
upon his companion. “I did know well how ’twould
be. I hear’d tell of brother’s being laid out, from
Bert Leerd, as I traipsed through Wild Pine this
morning.</p>

<p>“Ninsy Lintot was a-cryin’ enough to break her
poor heart. I hear’d ’un as I doddered down yon
lane. She were all lonesome-like, under them girt
trees, shakin’ and sobbin’ terrible. She took on so,
when I arst what ailed ’un, that I dursn’t lay finger
on the lass.</p>

<p>“She did right down scare I, Master Luke, and
that’s God’s holy truth! ‘Let me bide, Bessie,’ says
she, ‘let me bide.’ I telled her ’twas a sin to He
she loved best, to carry on so hopeless; and with that
she up and says,&mdash;‘I be the cause of it all, Bessie,’
says she, ‘I be the cause he throw’d ’isself away.’
And with that she set herself cryin’ again, like as
’twas pitiful to hear. ‘My darlin’, my darlin’,’ she
kept callin’ out. ‘I love no soul ’cept thee&mdash;no
soul ’cept thee!’</p>

<p>“’Twas then I recollected wot my old Mother used
to say, ’bout maids who be cryin’ like pantin’ hares.
‘Listen to me, Ninsy Lintot,’ I says, solemn and slow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
like as us were in church. ‘One above’s been talking
wi’ I, this blessed morn, and He do say as Master
James be in Abram’s Bosom, with them shining ones,
and it be shame and sin for mortals like we to wish
’un back.’</p>

<p>“That quieted the lass a bit, and I did tell she
then, wot be God’s truth, that ’tweren’t her at all
turned brother’s head, but the pleasure of the
Almighty. ‘’Tis for folks like us,’ I says to her, ‘to
take wot His will do send, and bide quiet and still,
same as cows, drove to barton.’</p>

<p>“’Twere a blessing of providence I’d met crazy
Bert afore I seed the lass, else I’d a been struck dazed-like
by wot she did tell. But as ’twas, thanks be
to recollectin’ mother’s trick wi’ such wendy maids,
I dried her poor eyes and got her back home along.
And she gave I summat to put in brother’s coffin
afore they do nail ’un down.”</p>

<p>Before either Luke or Mr. Quincunx had time to
utter any comment upon this narration, Witch-Bessie
unfastened the packet she was carrying, and produced
from a card-board box a large roughly-moulded
bracelet, or bangle, of heavy silver, such as may be
bought in the bazaars of Tunis or Algiers.</p>

<p>“There,” cried the old woman, holding the thing
up, and flashing it in the sun, “that’s wot she gave
I, to bury long wi’ brother! Be pretty enough,
baint ’un? Though, may-be, not fittin’ for a quiet
home-keeping lass like she. She had ’un off some
Gipoo, she said; and to my thinkin’ it be a kind of
heathen ornimint, same as folks do buy at Roger-town
Fair. But such as ’tis, that be wot ’tis bestowed
for, to put i’ the earth long wi’ brother. Seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
somethin’ of a pity, may-be, but maid’s whimsies be
maids’ whimsies, and God Almighty’ll plague the
hard-hearted folk as won’t perform wot they do cry
out for.”</p>

<p>Luke took the bangle from the old woman’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll do what she wants, Bessie,” he said.
“Poor little Ninsy, I never knew how much she
cared.”</p>

<p>He permitted Mr. Quincunx to handle the silver
object, and then carefully placed it in his
pocket.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he cried, “what else have you got,
Bessie?” This exclamation was caused by the fact
that Witch-Bessie, after fumbling in her shawl had
produced a second mysterious packet, smaller than
the first and tightly tied round with the stalks of some
sort of hedge-weed.</p>

<p>“Cards, by Heaven!” exclaimed Luke. “Oh Bessie,
Bessie,” he added, “why didn’t you bring these
round here twenty-four hours ago? You might have
made me take him with me to Weymouth!”</p>

<p>Untying the packet, which contained as the stone-carver
had anticipated, a pack of incredibly dirty
cards, the old woman without a word to either of
them, shuffled and sifted them, according to some
secret rule, and laid aside all but nine. These, almost,
but not entirely, consisting of court cards,
she spread out in a carefully concerted manner on
the grass at her feet.</p>

<p>Muttering over them some extraordinary gibberish,
out of which the two men could only catch the
following words,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Higgory, diggory, digg’d</div>
<div class="verse indent2">My sow has pigg’d.</div>
<div class="verse">There’s a good card for thee.</div>
<div class="verse">There’s a still better than he!</div>
<div class="verse">There is the best of all three,</div>
<div class="verse">And there is Niddy-noddee!”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Witch-Bessie picked up these nine cards, and shuffled
them long and fast.</p>

<p>She then handed them to Luke, face-downward, and
bade him draw seven out of the nine. These she once
more arranged, according to some occult plan, upon
the grass, and pondered over them with wrinkled brow.</p>

<p>“’Tis as ’twould be!” she muttered at last. “Cards
be wonderful crafty, though toads and efties, to my
thinkin’, be better, and a viper’s innards be God’s
very truth.”</p>

<p>Making, to Luke’s great disappointment, no further
allusion to the result of her investigations, the old
woman picked up the cards and went through the
whole process again, in honour of Mr. Quincunx.</p>

<p>This time, after bending for several minutes over
the solitary’s choice, she became more voluble.</p>

<p>“Thy heart’s wish be thine, dearie,” she said.
“But there be thwartings and blastings. Three
tears&mdash;three kisses&mdash;and a terrible journey. Us
shan’t have ’ee long wi’ we, in these ’ere parts. Thee
be marked and signed, master, by fallin’ stars and
flyin’ birds. There’s good sound wood gone to ship’s
keel wot’ll carry thee fast and far. Blastings and
thwartings! But thy heart’s wish be thine, dearie.”</p>

<p>The humourous nostrils of Mr. Quincunx and the
expressive curves of his bearded chin had twitched
and quivered as this sorcery began, but the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
woman’s reference to a “terrible journey” clouded
his countenance with blank dismay.</p>

<p>Luke pressed the sybil to be equally communicative
with regard to his own fate, but the old woman gathered
up her cards, twisted the same faded stalks
round the packet, and returned it to the folds of
her shawl. Then she struggled up upon her feet.</p>

<p>“Don’t leave us yet, Bessie,” said Luke. “I’ll
bring you out something to eat presently.”</p>

<p>Witch-Bessie’s only reply to this hospitable invitation
was confounding in its irrelevance. She
picked up her draggled skirt with her two hands, displaying
her unlaced boots and rumpled stockings,
and then, throwing back her wizened head, with its
rusty weather-bleached bonnet, and emitting a pallid
laugh from her toothless gums, she proceeded to
tread a sort of jerky measure, moving her old feet
to the tune of a shrill ditty.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Now we dance looby, looby, looby,</div>

<div class="verse">Shake your left hand a little,</div>
<div class="verse">And turn you round about.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Ye’ll both see I again, present,” she panted, when
this performance was over, “but bide where ’ee be,
bide where ’ee be now. Old Bessie’s said her say,
and she be due long of Hullaway Cross, come noon.”</p>

<p>As she hobbled off to the neighbouring stile, Luke
saw her kiss the tips of her fingers in the direction
of the station-master’s house.</p>

<p>“She’s bidding Daddy James good-bye,” he
thought. “What a world! ‘Looby, looby, looby!’
A proper Dance of Death for a son of my mother!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GRANARY</span></h2>

<p>Luke persuaded Mr. Quincunx to stay with
him for the station-master’s Sunday dinner,
and to stroll with him down to the churchyard
in the afternoon to decide, in consultation with the
sexton, upon the most suitable spot for his brother’s
interment. The stone-carver was resolved that this
spot should be removed as far as possible from the
grave of their parents, and the impiety of this resolution
was justified by the fact that Gideon’s tomb
was crowded on both sides by less aggressive sleepers.</p>

<p>They finally selected a remote place under the
southern wall, at the point where the long shadow
of the tower, in the late afternoon, flung its clear-outlined
battlements on the waving grass.</p>

<p>Luke continued to be entirely pleased with Mr.
Quincunx’s tact and sympathy. He felt he could
not have secured a better companion for this task
of selecting the final resting-place of the brother of
his soul. “Curse these fools,” he thought, “who rail
against this excellent man!” What mattered it,
after all, that the fellow hated what the world calls
“work,” and loved a peaceful life removed from
distraction?</p>

<p>The noble attributes of humour, of imagination,
of intelligence,&mdash;how much more important they were,
and conducive to the general human happiness, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
the mere power of making money! Compared with
the delicious twists and diverting convolutions in
Mr. Quincunx’s extraordinary brain, how dull, how
insipid, seemed such worldly cleverness!</p>

<p>The death of his brother had had the effect of
throwing these things into a new perspective. The
Machiavellian astuteness, which, in himself, in Romer,
in Mr. Taxater, and in many others, he had, until
now, regarded as of supreme value in the conduct
of life, seemed to him, as he regretfully bade the
recluse farewell and retraced his steps, far less essential,
far less important, than this imaginative sensitiveness
to the astounding spectacle of the world.</p>

<p>He fancied he discerned in front of him, as he
left the churchyard, the well-known figure of his newly
affianced Annie, and he made a detour through the
lane, to avoid her. He felt at that moment as
though nothing in the universe were interesting or
important except the sympathetic conversation of the
friends of one’s natural choice&mdash;persons of that
small, that fatally small circle, from which just now
the centre seemed to have dropped out!</p>

<p>Girls were a distraction, a pastime, a lure, an
intoxication; but a shock like this, casting one back
upon life’s essential verities, threw even lust itself
into the limbo of irrelevant things. All his recent
preoccupation with the love of women seemed to
him now, as though, in place of dreaming over the
mystery of the great tide of life, hand in hand with
initiated comrades, he were called upon to go launching
little paper-boats on its surface, full of fretful
anxiety as to whether they sank or floated.</p>

<p>Weighed down by the hopeless misery of his loss,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
he made his way slowly back to the station-master’s
house, too absorbed in his grief to speak to anyone.</p>

<p>After tea he became so wretched and lonely, that
he decided to walk over to Hullaway on the chance
of getting another glimpse of Witch-Bessie. Even
the sympathy of the station-master’s wife got on his
nerves and the romping of the children fretted and
chafed him.</p>

<p>He walked fast, swinging his stick and keeping his
eyes on the ground, his heart empty and desolate.
He followed the very path by which Gladys and he,
some few short weeks before, had returned in the
track of their two friends, from the Hullaway stocks.</p>

<p>Arriving at the village green, with its pond, its
elms, its raised pavement, and its groups of Sunday
loiterers, he turned into the churchyard. As we have
noted many times ere now, the appealing silence of
these places of the dead had an invincible charm for
him. It was perhaps a morbid tendency inherited
from his mother, or, on the other hand, it may have
been a pure æsthetic whim of his own, that led him,
with so magnetic an attraction, towards these oases
of mute patience, in the midst of the diurnal activities;
but whatever the spell was, Luke had never
found more relief in obeying it than he did at this
present hour.</p>

<p>He sat down in their favourite corner and looked
with interest at the various newly-blown wild-flowers,
which a few weeks’ lapse had brought to light. How
well he loved the pungent stringy stalks, the grey
leaves, the flat sturdy flowers of the “achillea” or
“yarrow”! Perhaps, above all the late summer blooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
he preferred these&mdash;finding, in their very coarseness
of texture and toughness of stem, something that
reassured and fortified. They were so bitter in their
herbal fragrance, so astringent in the tang of their
pungent taste, that they suggested to him the kind
of tonic cynicism, the sort of humorous courage and
gay disdain, with which it was his constant hope to
come at last to accept life.</p>

<p>It pleased him, above all when he found these
plants tinged with a delicious pink, as though the
juice of raspberries had been squeezed over them,
and it was precisely this tint he noticed now in a
large clump of them, growing on the sun-warmed
grave of a certain Hugh and Constance Foley,
former occupants of the old Manor House behind
him.</p>

<p>He wondered if this long-buried Hugh&mdash;a mysterious
and shadowy figure, about whom James and he
had often woven fantastic histories&mdash;had felt as
forlorn as he felt now, when he lost his Constance.
Could a Constance, or an Annie, or a Phyllis, ever
leave quite the void behind them such as now ached
and throbbed within him? Yes, he supposed so.
Men planted their heart’s loves in many various
soils, and when the hand of fate tugged them away,
it mattered little whether it was chalk, or sand, or
loam, that clung about the roots!</p>

<p>He looked long and long at the sunlit mounds,
over which the tombstones leaned at every conceivable
angle and upon which some had actually fallen prostrate.
These neglected monuments, and these tall
uncut grasses and flowers, had always seemed to
him preferable to the trim neatness of an enclosure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
like that of Athelston, which resembled the lawn of
a gentleman’s house.</p>

<p>James had often disputed with him on this point,
arguing, in a spirit of surly contradiction, in favour
of the wondrous effect of those red Athelston roses
hanging over clear-mown turf. The diverse suggestiveness
of graveyards was one of the brothers’ best-loved
topics, and innumerable cigarettes had they
both consumed, weighing this subject, on this very
spot.</p>

<p>Once more the hideous finality of the thing pierced
the heart of Luke with a devastating pang. On Wednesday
next,&mdash;that is, after the lapse of two brief
days,&mdash;he would bid farewell, for ever and ever and
ever, to the human companion with whom he had
shared all he cared for in life!</p>

<p>He remembered a little quarrel he once had with
James, long ago, in this very place, and how it had
been the elder and not the younger who had made
the first overtures of reconciliation, and how James
had given him an old pair of silver links,&mdash;he was
wearing them at that moment!&mdash;as a kind of peace-offering.
He recollected what a happy evening they
had spent together after that event, and how they
had read “Thus spake Zarathustra” in the old formidable
English translation&mdash;the mere largeness of the
volume answering to the largeness of the philosopher’s
thought.</p>

<p>Never again would they two “take on them,” in
the sweet Shakespearean phrase, “the mystery of
things, as though they were God’s spies.”</p>

<p>Luke set himself to recall, one by one, innumerable
little incidents of their life together. He remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
various occasions in which, partly out of pure contrariness,
but partly also out of a certain instinctive bias
in his blood, he had defended their father against
his brother’s attacks. He recalled one strange conversation
they had had, under the withy-stumps of
Badger’s Bottom, as they returned through the dusk
of a November day, from a long walk over the
southern hills. It had to do with the appearance of
a cloud-swept crescent moon above the Auber woods.</p>

<p>James had maintained that were he a pagan of
the extinct polytheistic faith, he would have worshipped
the moon, and willingly offered her, night
by night,&mdash;he used the pious syllables of the great
hedonist,&mdash;her glittering wax tapers upon the sacred
wheaten cake. Luke, on the contrary, had sworn
that the sun, and no lesser power, was the god of
his idolatry, and he imagined himself in place of his
brother’s wax candles, pouring forth, morning by
morning, a rich libation of gold wine to that bright
lord of life.</p>

<p>This instinctive division of taste between the two,
had led, over and over again, to all manner of friendly
dissension.</p>

<p>Luke recalled how often he had rallied James upon
his habit of drifting into what the younger brother
pertinently described as a “translunar mood.” He
was “translunar” enough now, at any rate; but now
it was in honour of that other “lady of the night,”
of that dreadful “double” of his moon-goddess&mdash;the
dark pomegranate-bearer&mdash;that the candles must
be lit!</p>

<p>Luke revived in his mind, as he watched the slow-shifting
shadows move from grave to grave, all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
indescribable “little things” of their every-day life
together, the loss of which seemed perhaps worst
of all. He recalled how on gusty December evenings
they would plod homeward from some Saturday
afternoon’s excursion to Yeoborough, and how the
cheerful firelight from the station-master’s house
would greet them as they crossed the railway.</p>

<p>So closely had their thoughts and sensations grown
together, that there were many little poignant memories,
out of the woven texture of which he found
himself quite unable to disentangle the imaginative
threads that were due to his brother, from such as
were the evocation of his own temperament.</p>

<p>One such concentrated moment, of exquisite memory,
he associated with an old farm-house on the
edge of the road leading from Hullaway to Rogerstown.
This road,&mdash;a forlorn enough highway of
Roman origin, dividing a level plain of desolate rain-flooded
meadows,&mdash;was one of their favourite haunts.
“Halfway House,” as the farm-dwelling was called,
especially appealed to them, because of its romantic
and melancholy isolation.</p>

<p>Luke remembered how he had paused with his
brother one clear frosty afternoon when the puddles
by the road-side were criss-crossed by little broken
stars of fresh-formed ice, and had imagined how they
would feel if such a place belonged to them by hereditary
birthright, what they would feel were they even
now returning there, between the tall evergreens
at the gate, to spend a long evening over a log fire,
with mulled claret on the hob, and cards and books
on the table, and a great white Persian cat,&mdash;this
was James’ interpolation!&mdash;purring softly, and rubbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
its silky sides against Chinese vases full of
rose-leaves.</p>

<p>Strange journeys his mind took, that long unforgettable
afternoon,&mdash;the first of his life spent without
his brother! He saw before him, at one moment,
a little desolate wooden pier, broken by waves and
weather, somewhere on the Weymouth coast. The indescribable
pathos of things outworn and done with,
of things abandoned by man and ill-used by nature,
had given to this derelict pile of drift-wood a curious
prominence in his House of Memory. He remembered
the look with which James had regarded it, and how
the wind had whistled through it and how they had
tried in vain to light their cigarettes under its
shelter.</p>

<p>At another moment his mind swung back to the
daily routine in their pleasant lodging. He recalled
certain spring mornings when they had risen together
at dawn and had crept stealthily out, for fear of waking
their landlady. He vividly remembered the peculiar
smell of moss and primroses with which the air seemed
full on one of these occasions.</p>

<p>The place Luke had chosen for summoning up all
these ghosts of the past held him with such a spell
that he permitted the church-bells to ring and the
little congregation to assemble for the evening
service without moving or stirring. “Hugh and
Constance Foley” he kept repeating to himself, as the
priest’s voice, within the sacred building, intoned the
prayers. The sentiment of the plaintive hymn with
which the service closed,&mdash;he hardly moved or stirred
for the brief hour of the liturgy’s progress,&mdash;brought
tears, the first he had shed since his brother’s death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
to this wanton faun’s eyes. What is there, he thought,
in these wistful tunes, and impossible, too-sweet
words, that must needs hit the most cynical of
sceptics?</p>

<p>He let the people shuffle out and drift away, and
the grey-haired parson and his silk-gowned wife follow
them and vanish, and still he did not stir. For
some half-an-hour longer he remained in the same
position, his chin upon his knees, staring gloomily
in front of him. He was still seated so, when, to
the eyes of an observer posted on the top of the
tower, two persons, the first a woman and the second
a man, would have been observed approaching,
by a rarely-traversed field-path, the side of the enclosure
most remote from Hullaway Green.</p>

<p>The path upon which these figures advanced was
interrupted at certain intervals by tall elm-trees, and
it would have been clear to our imaginary watcher
upon the tower that the second of the two was glad
enough of the shelter of these trees, of which it was
evident he intended to make use, did the first figure
turn and glance backward.</p>

<p>Had such a sentinel been possessed of local knowledge
he would have had no difficulty in recognizing
the first of these persons as Gladys Romer and the
second as Mr. Clavering.</p>

<p>Gladys had, in fact, gone alone to the evening
service, on the ground of celebrating the close of her
baptismal day. Immediately after the service she
had slipped off down the street leading to the railroad,
directing her steps towards Hullaway, whither
a sure instinct told her Luke had wandered.</p>

<p>She was still in sight, having got no further than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
the entrance to Splash Lane, when Clavering, who
had changed his surplice with lightning rapidity,
issued forth into the street. In a flash he remarked
the direction of her steps, and impelled by an impulse
of mad jealousy, began blindly following her.</p>

<p>Not a few heads were inquisitively turned, and not
a few whispering comments were exchanged, as first
the squire’s daughter, and then the young clergyman,
made their way through the street.</p>

<p>As soon as Gladys had crossed the railroad and
struck out at a sharp pace up the slope of the meadow
Clavering realized that wherever she intended to go
it was not to the house in which lay James Andersen.
Torn with intolerable jealousy, and anxious, at all
risks, to satisfy his mind, one way or the other, as
to her relations with Luke, he deliberately decided to
follow the girl to whatever hoped-for encounter, or
carefully plotted assignation, she was now directing
her steps. How true, how exactly true, to his interpretation
of Luke’s character, was this astutely arranged
meeting, on the very day after his brother’s
death!</p>

<p>At the top of the station-field Gladys paused for
a moment, and, turning round, contemplated the
little dwelling which was now a house of the dead.</p>

<p>Luckily for Mr. Clavering, this movement of hers
coincided with his arrival at the thick-set hedge separating
the field from the metal track. He waited at
the turn-stile until, her abstraction over, she passed
into the lane.</p>

<p>All the way to Hullaway Mr. Clavering followed
her, hurriedly concealing himself when there seemed
the least danger of discovery, and at certain critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
moments making slight deviations from the direct
pursuit.</p>

<p>As she drew near the churchyard the girl showed
evident signs of nervousness and apprehension,
walking more slowly, and looking about her, and sometimes
even pausing as if to take breath and collect
her thoughts.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for her pursuer at this final moment
of the chase that the row of colossal elms, of
which mention has been made, interposed themselves
between the two. Clavering was thus able to approach
quite close to the girl before she reached her destination,
for, making use of these rugged trunks, as an
Indian scout might have done, he was almost within
touch of her by the time she clambered over the
railings.</p>

<p>The savage bite of insane jealousy drove from the
poor priest’s head any thought of how grotesque he
must have appeared,&mdash;could any eyes but those of
field-mice and starlings have observed him,&mdash;with his
shiny black frock-coat and broad-brimmed hat, peeping
and spying in the track of this fair young person.</p>

<p>With a countenance convulsed with helpless fury
he watched the girl walk slowly and timidly up to
Luke’s side, and saw the stone-carver recognize her
and rise to greet her. He could not catch their
words, though he strained his ears to do so, but their
gestures and attitudes were quite distinguishable.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, little wonder that the agitated
priest could not overhear what Gladys said, for the
extreme nervousness under which she laboured made
her first utterances so broken and low that even
her interlocutor could scarcely follow them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span></p>

<p>She laid a pleading hand on Luke’s arm. “I was
unhappy,” she murmured, “I was unhappy, and I
wanted to tell you. I’ve been thinking about you all
day. I heard of his death quite early in the morning.
Luke,&mdash;you’re not angry with me any more, are
you? I’d have done anything that this shouldn’t
have happened!”</p>

<p>Luke looked at her searchingly, but made, at the
same time, an impatient movement of his arm, so
that the hand she had placed upon his sleeve fell
to her side.</p>

<p>“Let’s get away from here, Luke,” she implored;
“anywhere,&mdash;across the fields,&mdash;I told them at
home I might go for a walk after church. It’ll be
all right. No one will know.”</p>

<p>“Across the fields&mdash;eh?” replied the stone-carver.
“Well&mdash;I don’t mind. What do you say to a walk
to Rogerstown? I haven’t been there since I went
with James, and there’ll be a moon to get home by.”
He looked at her intently, with a certain bitter humour
lurking in the curve of his lips.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances it was with the
utmost difficulty that Gladys could be persuaded to
walk anywhere. Her lethargic nature detested that
kind of exercise. He was amazed at the alacrity with
which she accepted the offer.</p>

<p>Her eyes quite lit up. “I’d love that, Luke, I’d
simply love it!” she cried eagerly. “Let’s start! I’ll
walk as fast as you like&mdash;and I don’t care how late
we are!”</p>

<p>They moved out of the churchyard together, by the
gate opening on the green.</p>

<p>Luke was interested, but not in the least touched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
by the girl’s chastened and submissive manner. His
suggestion about Rogerstown was really more of a
sort of test than anything else, to see just how far
this clinging passivity of hers would really go.</p>

<p>As they followed the lane leading out of one of the
side-alleys of the village towards the Roman Road,
the stone-carver could not help indulging in a certain
amount of silent psychological analysis in regard to
this change of heart in his fair mistress. He seemed
to get a vision of the great world-passions, sweeping
at random through the universe, and bending the
most obstinate wills to their caprice.</p>

<p>On the one hand, he thought, there is that absurd
Mr. Clavering,&mdash;simple, pure-minded, a veritable
monk of God,&mdash;driven almost insane with Desire,
and on the other, here is Gladys,&mdash;naturally as
selfish and frivolous a young pagan as one could
wish to amuse oneself with,&mdash;driven almost insane
with self-oblivious love! They were like earthquakes
and avalanches, like whirlpools and water-spouts,
he thought, these great world-passions! They could
overwhelm all the good in one person, and all the
evil in another, with the same sublime indifference,
and in themselves&mdash;remain non-moral, superhuman,
elemental!</p>

<p>In the light of this vision, Luke could not resist a
hurried mental survey of the various figures in his
personal drama. He wondered how far his own love
for James could be said to belong to this formidable
category. No! He supposed that both he and Mr.
Quincunx were too self-possessed, or too epicurean,
ever to be thus swept out of their path. His brother
was clearly a victim of these erotic Valkyries, so was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
Ninsy Lintot, and in a lesser degree, he shrewdly
surmised, young Philip Wone. He himself, he supposed,
was, in these things, amorous and vicious
rather than passionate. So he had always imagined
Gladys to have been. But Gladys had been as completely
swept out of the shallows of her viciousness,
by this overpowering obsession, as Mr. Clavering
had been swept out of the shallows of his puritanism,
by the same power. If that fantastic theory of Vennie
Seldom’s about the age-long struggle between the two
Hills&mdash;between the stone of the one and the wood of
the other&mdash;had any germ of truth in it, it was clear
that these elemental passions belonged to a region
of activity remote from either, and as indifferent to
both, as the great zodiacal signs were indifferent to
the solar planets.</p>

<p>Luke had just arrived at this philosophical, or, if
the reader pleases, mystical conclusion, when they
emerged upon the Roman Road.</p>

<p>Ascending an abrupt hill, the last eminence between
Hullaway and far-distant ranges, they found themselves
looking down over an immense melancholy
plain, in the centre of which, on the banks of a muddy
river, stood the ancient Roman stronghold of Rogerstown,
the birth-place, so Luke always loved to remind
himself, of the famous monkish scientist Roger
Bacon.</p>

<p>The sun had already disappeared, and the dark line
of the Mendip Hills on the northern horizon were
wrapped in a thick, purple haze.</p>

<p>The plain they looked down upon was cut into two
equal segments by the straight white road they were
to follow,&mdash;if Luke was serious in his intention,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span>
all along the edges of the road, and spreading in
transverse lines across the level fields, were deep,
reedy ditches, bordered in places by pollard willows.</p>

<p>The whole plain, subject, in autumn and winter,
to devastating floods, was really a sort of inlet or
estuary of the great Somersetshire marshes, lying
further west, which are collectively known as
Sedgemoor.</p>

<p>Gladys could not refrain from giving vent to a
slight movement of instinctive reluctance, when she
saw how close the night was upon them, and how long
the road seemed, but she submissively suppressed any
word of protest, when, with a silent touch upon
her arm, her companion led her forward, down the
shadowy incline.</p>

<p>Their figures were still visible&mdash;two dark isolated
forms upon the pale roadway&mdash;when, hot and panting,
Mr. Clavering arrived at the same hill-top. With a
sigh of profound relief he recognized that he had not
lost his fugitives. The only question was, where
were they going, and for what purpose? He remained
for several minutes gloomy and watchful at his post
of observation.</p>

<p>They were now nearly half a mile across the plain,
and their receding figures had already begun to grow
indistinct in the twilight, when Mr. Clavering saw
them suddenly leave the road and debouch to the
left. “Ah!” he muttered to himself, “They’re going
home by Hullaway Chase!”</p>

<p>This Hullaway Chase was a rough tract of pasturage
a little to the east of the level flats, and raised
slightly above them. From its southern extremity a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
long narrow lane, skirting the outlying cottages of
the village, led straight across the intervening uplands
to Nevilton Park. It was clearly towards this lane,
by a not much frequented foot-path over the ditches,
that Gladys and Luke were proceeding.</p>

<p>To anyone as well acquainted as Clavering was
with the general outline of the country the route that
the lovers&mdash;or whatever their curious relation
justifies us in calling them&mdash;must needs take, to
return to Nevilton, was now as clearly marked as
if it were indicated on a map.</p>

<p>“Curse him!” muttered the priest, “I hope he’s
not going to drown her in those brooks!”</p>

<p>He let his gaze wander across the level expanse at
his feet. How could he get close to them, he wondered,
so as to catch even a stray sentence or two of
what they were saying.</p>

<p>His passion had reached such a point of insanity
that he longed to be transformed into one of those
dark-winged rooks that now in a thin melancholy line
were flying over their heads, so that he might swoop
down above them and follow them&mdash;follow them&mdash;every
step of the way! He was like a man drawn to
the edge of a precipice and magnetized by the very
danger of the abyss. To be near them, to listen to
what they said,&mdash;the craving for that possessed him
with a fixed and obstinate hunger!</p>

<p>Suddenly he shook his cane in the air and almost
leaped for joy. He remembered the existence, at
the spot where the lane they were seeking began, of
a large dilapidated barn, used, by the yeoman-farmer
to whom the Chase belonged, as a rough store-house
for cattle-food. The spot was so attractive a resting-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
for persons tired with walking, that it seemed
as though it would be a strange chance indeed if the
two wanderers did not take advantage of it. The
point was, could he forestall them and arrive there
first?</p>

<p>He surveyed the landscape around him with an
anxious eye. It seemed as though by following the
ridge of the hill upon which he stood, and crossing
every obstacle that intervened, he ought to be able
to do so&mdash;and to do so without losing sight of the
two companions, as they unsuspiciously threaded their
way over the flats.</p>

<p>Having made his resolution, he lost no time in
putting it into action. He clambered without difficulty
into the meadow on his right, and breaking,
in his excitement, into a run, he forced his way
through three successive bramble-hedges, and as
many dew-drenched turnip-fields, without the least
regard to the effect of this procedure upon his Sunday
attire.</p>

<p>Every now and then, as the contours of the ground
served, he caught a glimpse of the figures in the valley
below, and the sight hastened the impetuosity of his
speed. Once he felt sure he observed them pause
and exchange an embrace, but this may have been
an illusive mirage created by the mad fumes of the
tempestuous jealousy which kept mounting higher
and higher into his head. Recklessly and blindly he
rushed on, performing feats of agility and endurance,
such as in normal hours would have been utterly
impossible.</p>

<p>From the moment he decided upon this desperate
undertaking, to the moment, when, hot, breathless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
and dishevelled, he reached his destination, only a
brief quarter of an hour had elapsed.</p>

<p>He entered the barn leaving the door wide-open
behind him. In its interior tightly packed bundles
of dark-coloured hay rose up almost to the roof. The
floor was littered with straw and newly-cut clover.</p>

<p>On one side of the barn, beneath the piled-up hay,
was a large shelving heap of threshed oats. Here, obviously,
was the sort of place, if the lovers paused at
this spot at all, where they would be tempted to recline.</p>

<p>Directly opposite these oats, in the portion of the
shed that was most in shadow, Clavering observed
a narrow slit between the hay-bundles. He approached
this aperture and tried to wedge himself
into it. The protruding stalks of the hay pricked his
hands and face, and the dust choked him.</p>

<p>With angry coughs and splutters, and with sundry
savage expletives by no means suitable to a priest of
the church, he at length succeeded in firmly imbedding
himself in this impenetrable retreat. He worked himself
so far into the shadow, that not the most cautious
eye could have discerned his presence. His sole
danger lay in the fact that the dust might very easily
give him an irresistible fit of sneezing. With the
cessation of his violent struggles, however, this danger
seemed to diminish; for the dust subsided as quickly
as it had been raised, and otherwise, as he leant
luxuriously back upon his warm-scented support, his
position was by no means uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Luke and Gladys were slowly and deliberately
crossing the darkening water-meadows.</p>

<p>Gladys, whose geographical knowledge of the district
was limited to the immediate vicinity of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
home had not the remotest guess as to where she
was being led. For all she knew Luke might have
gone crazy, like his brother, and be now intending to
plunge both himself and her into the depths of some
lonely pool or weir. Nevertheless, she continued
passively and meekly following him, walking, when
the path along the dyke’s edge narrowed, at some few
paces behind him, with that peculiar air of being a
led animal, which one often observes in the partners
of tramps, as they plod the roads in the wake of their
masters.</p>

<p>The expanse they traversed in this manner was
possessed of a peculiar character of its own, a character
which that especial hour of twilight seemed to
draw forth and emphasize. It differed from similar
tracts of marsh-land, such as may be found by the
sea’s edge, in being devoid of any romantic horizon
to afford a spiritual escape from the gloom it diffused.</p>

<p>It was melancholy. It was repellant. It was sinister.
It lacked the element of poetic expansiveness.
It gave the impression of holding grimly to some
dark obscene secret, which no visitation of sun or
moon would ever cajole it into divulging.</p>

<p>It depressed without overwhelming. It saddened
without inspiring. With its reeds, its mud, its willows,
its livid phosphorescent ditches, it produced
uneasiness rather than awe, and disquietude rather
than solemnity.</p>

<p>Bounded by rolling hills on all sides save one, it
gave the persons who moved across it the sensation
of being enclosed in some vast natural arena.</p>

<p>Gladys wished she had brought her cloak with
her, as the filmy white mists rose like ghosts out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
the stagnant ditches, and with clammy persistence
invaded her unprotected form.</p>

<p>It was one of those places that seem to suggest the
transaction of no stirring or heroic deeds, but of
gloomy, wretched, chance-driven occurrences. A betrayed
army might have surrendered there.</p>

<p>Luke seemed to give himself up with grim reciprocity
to the influences of the spot. He appeared
totally oblivious of his meek companion, and except
to offer her languid, absent-minded assistance across
various gates and dams, he remained as completely
wrapped in reserve as were the taciturn levels over
which they passed.</p>

<p>It was with an incredible sense of relief that Gladys
found herself in the drier, more wholesome, atmosphere
of Hullaway Chase. Here, as they walked
briskly side by side over the thyme-scented turf, it
seemed that the accumulated heat of the day, which,
from the damp marsh-land only drew forth miasmic
vapours, flung into the fragrant air delicious waftings
of warm earth-breath. With still greater relief, and
even with a little cry of joy, she caught sight of the
friendly open door of the capacious barn, and the
shadowy inviting heap of loose-flung oats lying beneath
its wall of hay.</p>

<p>“Oh, we must go in here!” she cried, “what an
adorable place!”</p>

<p>They entered, and the girl threw upon Luke one of
her slow, long, amorous glances. “Kiss me!” she
said, holding up her mouth to him beseechingly.</p>

<p>The faint light of the dying day fell with a pale
glimmer upon her soft throat and rounded chin.
Luke found himself disinclined to resist her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span></p>

<p>There were tears on the girl’s cheek when, loosening
her hold upon his neck, she sank down on the idyllic
couch offered them, and closed her eyes in childish
contentment.</p>

<p>Luke hung over her thoughtfully and sadly. There
is always something sad,&mdash;something that seems to
bring with it a withering breath from the ultimate
futility of the universe,&mdash;about a lover’s recognition
that the form which formerly thrilled him with
ecstasy, now leaves him cold and unmoved. Such
sadness, chilly and desolate as the hand of death
itself, crept over the stone-carver’s heart, as he looked
at the gently-stirring breast and softly-parted lips
of his beautiful mistress. He bent down and kissed
her forehead, caressing her passively yielded fingers.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and smiled at him, the lingering
smile of a soothed and happy infant.</p>

<p>They remained thus, silent and at rest, for several
moments. It was not long, however, before the
subtle instinct of an enamoured woman made the
girl aware that her friend’s responsiveness had been
but a momentary impulse. She started up, her eyes
wide-open and her lips trembling.</p>

<p>“Luke!” she murmured, “Luke, darling,&mdash;” Her
voice broke, in a curious little sob.</p>

<p>Luke gazed at her blankly, thankful that the weight
of weary foreknowledge upon his face was concealed
from her by the growing darkness.</p>

<p>“I want to say to you, my dear love,” the girl
went on, her bosom rising and falling in pitiful embarrassment,
and her white fingers nervously scooping
up handful after handful of the shadowy grain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want to say to you something that is&mdash;that
is very serious&mdash;for us both, Luke,&mdash;I want to
tell you,&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her voice once more died away, in the same inarticulate
and curious gurgle, like the sob of water
running under a weir.</p>

<p>Luke rose to his feet and stood in front of her.
“It’s all right,” he said calmly. “You needn’t agitate
yourself. I understand.”</p>

<p>The girl covered her face with her hands. “But
what shall I do? What shall I do?” she sobbed. “I
can’t marry Ralph like this. He’ll kill me when he
finds out. I’m so afraid of him, Luke&mdash;you don’t
know,&mdash;you don’t know,&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’ll forgive you,” answered the stone-carver
quietly. “He’s not a person to burst out like that.
Lots of people have to confess these little things after
they’re married. Some men aren’t half so particular
as you girls think.”</p>

<p>Gladys raised her head and gave her friend a long
queer look, the full import of which was concealed
from him in the darkness. She made a futile little
groping movement with her hand.</p>

<p>“Luke,” she whispered, “I must just say this to
you even if it makes you angry. I shouldn’t be happy
afterwards&mdash;whatever happens&mdash;if I didn’t say it.
I want you to know that I’m ready, if you wish, if&mdash;if
you love me enough for that, Luke,&mdash;to go away
with you anywhere! I feel it isn’t as it used to be.
I feel everything’s different. But I want you to know,&mdash;to
know without any mistake&mdash;that I’d go at
once&mdash;willingly&mdash;wherever you took me!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span></p>
<p>“It’s not that I’m begging you to marry me,”
she wailed, “it’s only that I love you, love you and
want you so frightfully, my darling!</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry you, Luke,” she added, in a low,
pitiful little voice, that seemed to emerge rather from
the general shadowiness of the place than from a
human being’s lips, “I wouldn’t tease you, or scold
you when you enjoyed yourself! It’s only that I
want to be with you, that I want to be near you.
I never thought it would come to this. I thought&mdash;”
Her voice died away again into the darkness.</p>

<p>Luke began pacing up and down the floor of the
barn.</p>

<p>Once more she spoke. “I’d be faithful to you,
Luke, married or unmarried,&mdash;and I’d work,
though I know you won’t believe that. But I can
do quite hard work, when I like!”</p>

<p>By some malignity of chance, or perhaps by a
natural reaction from her pleading words, Luke’s mind
reverted to her tone and temper on that June morning
when she insulted him by a present of money.</p>

<p>“No, Gladys,” he said. “It won’t do. You and
I weren’t made for each other. There are certain
things&mdash;many things&mdash;in me that you’ll never
understand, and I daresay there are things in you
that I never shall. We’re not made for one another,
child, I tell you. We shouldn’t be happy for a week.
I know myself, and I know you, and I’m sure it
wouldn’t do.</p>

<p>“Don’t you fret yourself about Dangelis. If he
finds out, he finds out&mdash;and that’s the end of it.
But I swear to you that I know <em>him</em> well enough to
know that you’ve nothing to be afraid of&mdash;even if
he does find out. He’s not the kind of man to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
a fuss. I can see exactly the way he’d take it. He’d
be sorry for you and laugh at himself, and plunge
desperately into his painting.</p>

<p>“I like Dangelis, I tell you frankly. I think he’s
a thoroughly generous and large-minded fellow. Of
course I’ve hardly seen him to speak to, but you
can’t be mistaken about a man like that. At least
I can’t! I seem to know him in and out, up hill and
down dale.</p>

<p>“Make a fuss? Not he! He’ll make this country
ring and ting with the fame of his pictures. That’s
what he’ll do! And as for being horrid to you&mdash;not
he! I know him better than that. He’ll be too much
in love with you, too,&mdash;you little demon! That’s
another point to bear in mind.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll have the whip-hand of him, never fear,&mdash;and
our son,&mdash;I hope it <em>is</em> a son my dear!&mdash;will
be treated as if it were his own.</p>

<p>“I know him, I tell you! He’s a thoroughly decent
fellow, though a bit of a fool, no doubt. But we’re
all that!</p>

<p>“Don’t you be a little goose, Gladys, and get
fussed up and worried over nothing. After all, what
does it matter? Life’s such a mad affair anyway!
All we can do is to map things to the best of our
ability, and then chance it.</p>

<p>“We’re all on the verge of a precipice. Do you
think I don’t realize that? But that’s no reason why
we should rush blindly up to the thing, and throw
ourselves over. And it would be nothing else than
that, nothing else than sheer madness, for you and I
to go off together.</p>

<p>“Do you think your father would give us a penny?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
Not he! I detect in your father, Gladys, an extraordinary
vein of obstinacy. You haven’t clashed
up against it yet, but try and play any of these games
on him, and you’ll see!</p>

<p>“No; one thing you may be perfectly sure of, and
that is, that whatever he finds out, Dangelis will
never breathe a word to your father. He’s madly in
love with you, girl, I tell you; and if I’m out of the
way, you’ll be able to do just what you like with
him!”</p>

<p>It was completely dark now, and when Luke’s
oration came to an end there was no sound in the
barn except a low sobbing.</p>

<p>“Come on, child; we must be getting home, or
you’ll be frightfully late. Here! give me your hand.
Where are you?”</p>

<p>He groped about in the darkness until his sleeve
brushed against her shoulder. It was trembling under
her efforts to suppress her sobs.</p>

<p>He got hold of her wrists and pulled her to her
feet. “Come on, my dear,” he repeated, “we must
get out of this now. Give me one nice kiss before
we go.”</p>

<p>She permitted herself to be caressed&mdash;passive and
unresisting in his arms.</p>

<p>In the darkness they touched the outer edge of
Mr. Clavering’s hiding-place, and the girl, swaying
a little backwards under Luke’s endearments, felt
the pressure of the hay-wall behind her. She did not,
however, feel the impassioned touch of the choking
kiss which the poor imprisoned priest desperately
imprinted on a loose tress of her hair.</p>

<p>It was one of those pitiful and grotesque situations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
which seem sometimes to arise,&mdash;as our fantastic
planet turns on its orbit,&mdash;for no other purpose
than that of gratifying some malign vein of goblin-like
irony in the system of things.</p>

<p>That at the moment when Luke, under the spell
of the shadowy fragrance of the place, and the pliant
submissiveness of the girl’s form, threw something
of his old ardour into his kiss, her other, more desperate
love should have dared such an approach, was
a coincidence apparently of the very kind to appeal
to the perverse taste of this planetary humour.</p>

<p>The actual result of such a strange consentaneousness
of rival emotion was that the three human
heads remained for a brief dramatic moment in close
juxtaposition,&mdash;the two fair ones and the dark one
so near one another, that it might have seemed almost
inevitable that their thoughts should interact in that
fatal proximity.</p>

<p>The pitiful pathos of the whole human comedy
might well have been brought home to any curious
observer able to pierce that twilight! Such an observer
would have felt towards those three poor obsessed
craniums the same sort of tenderness that
they themselves would have been conscious of, had
they suddenly come across a sleeping person or a
dead body.</p>

<p>Strange, that the ultimate pity in these things,&mdash;in
this blind antagonistic striving of human desires
under such gracious flesh and blood&mdash;should only
arouse these tolerant emotions when they are no longer
of any avail! Had some impossible bolt from heaven
stricken these three impassioned ones in their tragic
approximation, how,&mdash;long afterwards,&mdash;the discoverer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
of the three skeletons would have moralized
upon their fate! As it was, there was nothing but
the irony of the gods to read what the irony of the
gods was writing upon that moment’s drowning
sands.</p>

<p>When Luke and Gladys left the barn, and hurriedly,
under the rising moon, retook their way towards
Nevilton, Clavering emerged from his concealment
dazed and stupefied. He threw himself down in the
darkness on the heap of oats and strove to give form
and coherence to the wild flood of thoughts which
swept through him.</p>

<p>So this was what he had come out to learn! This
was the knowledge that his mad jealousy had driven
him to snatch!</p>

<p>He thought of the exquisite sacredness&mdash;for him&mdash;of
that morning’s ritual in the church, and of how
easily he had persuaded himself to read into the
girl’s preoccupied look something more than natural
sadness over Andersen’s death. He had indeed,&mdash;only
those short hours ago,&mdash;allowed himself the
sweet illusion that this religious initiation really
meant, for his pagan love, some kind of Vita
Nuova.</p>

<p>The fates had rattled their dice, however, to a
different tune. The unfortunate girl was indeed
entering upon a Vita Nuova, but how hideously different
a one from that which had been his hope!</p>

<p>On Wednesday came the confirmation service.
How could he,&mdash;with any respect for his conscience
as a guardian of these sacred rites,&mdash;permit Gladys
to be confirmed now? Yet what ought he to do?
Drops of cold sweat stood upon his forehead as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
wondered whether it was incumbent upon him to
take the first train the following morning for the
bishop’s palace and to demand an interview.</p>

<p>No. Tomorrow the prelate would be starting on
his episcopal tour. Clavering would have to pursue
him from one remote country village to another, and
what a pursuit that would be! He recoiled from the
idea with sick aversion.</p>

<p>Could he then suppress his fatal knowledge and let
the event take place without protest? To act in
such a manner would be nothing less than to play
the part of an accomplice in the girl’s sin.</p>

<p>Perhaps when the bishop actually appeared he
would be able to secure a confidential interview with
him and lay the whole matter before him. Or should
he act on his own responsibility, and write to Gladys
himself, telling her that under the circumstances it
would be best for her to stay away from the ceremony?</p>

<p>What reason could he give for such an extraordinary
mandate? Could he bluntly indicate to her, in black
and white, the secret he had discovered, and the
manner of its discovery? To accuse her on the ground
of mere village gossip would be to lay himself open
to shameful humiliation. Was he, in any case, justified
in putting the fatal information, gathered in this
way, to so drastic a use? It was only in his madness
as a jealous lover that he had possessed himself of
this knowledge. As priest of Nevilton he knew
nothing.</p>

<p>He had no right to know anything. No; he must
pay the penalty of his shameful insanity by bearing
this burden in silence, even though his conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
groaned and cracked beneath the weight. Such a
silence, with its attendant misery of self-accusation
and shame, was all he could offer to his treacherous
enchantress as a tacit recompense for having stolen
her secret.</p>

<p>He rose and left the granary. As he walked homeward,
along the Nevilton road, avoiding by a sort
of scrupulous reaction the shorter route followed by
the others, it seemed to him as though the night had
never been more sultry, or the way more loaded with
the presence of impendent calamity.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="smaller">METAMORPHOSIS</span></h2>

<p>The day of James Andersen’s funeral and of
Gladys’ confirmation happened to coincide with
a remarkable and unexpected event in the life
of Mr. Quincunx. Whatever powers, lurking in air
or earth, were attempting at that moment to influence
the fatal stream of events in Nevilton, must
have been grimly conscious of something preordained
and inevitable about this eccentric man’s drift towards
appalling moral disaster.</p>

<p>It seemed as though nothing on earth now could
stop the marriage of Lacrima and Goring, and from
the point of view of the moralist, or even of the person
of normal decency, such a marriage, if it really
did lead to Mr. Quincunx’s pensioning at the hands
of his enemy, necessarily held over him a shame and
a disgrace proportionate to the outrage done to the
girl who loved him. What these evil powers played
upon, if evil powers they were,&mdash;and not the blind
laws of cause and effect,&mdash;was the essential character
of Mr. Quincunx, which nothing in heaven nor earth
seemed able to change.</p>

<p>There are often, however, elements in our fate,
which lie, it might seem, deeper than any calculable
prediction, deeper, it may be, than the influence of
the most powerful supernatural agents, and these
elements&mdash;unstirred by angel or devil&mdash;are sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
roused to activity by the least expected cause.
It is, at these moments, as though Fate, in the incalculable
comprehensiveness of her immense designs,
condescended to make use of Chance, her elfish
sister, to carry out what the natural and normal
stream of things would seem to have decreed as an
impossibility.</p>

<p>Probably not a living soul who knew him,&mdash;certainly
not Lacrima,&mdash;had the least expectation of
any chance of change in Mr. Quincunx. But then
none of these persons had really sounded the depths
in the soul of the man. There were certain mysterious
and unfathomable gulfs in the sea-floor of Mr. Quincunx’s
being which would have exhausted all the sorceries
of Witch-Bessie even to locate.</p>

<p>So fantastic and surprising are the ways of destiny,
that,&mdash;as shall be presently seen,&mdash;what
neither gods nor devils, nor men nor angels, could
effect, was effected by nothing more nor less than a
travelling circus.</p>

<p>The day of the burying of James and the confirmation
of Gladys brought into Nevilton a curious
cortège of popular entertainers. This cortège consisted
of one of those small wandering circuses, which,
during the month of August are wont to leave the
towns and move leisurely among the remoter country
villages, staying nowhere more than a night, and
taking advantage of any local festival or club-meeting
to enhance their popularity.</p>

<p>The circus in question,&mdash;flamingly entitled
Porter’s Universal World-Show,&mdash;was owned and
conducted by a certain Job Love, a shrewd and avaricious
ruffian, who boasted, though with little justification,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
the inheritance of gipsy blood. As a matter
of fact, the authentic gipsy tribes gave Mr. Love an
extremely wide berth, avoiding his path as they would
have avoided the path of the police. This cautious
attitude was not confined, however, to gipsies. Every
species of itinerant hawker and pedler avoided the
path of Mr. Love, and the few toy-booths and sweet-stalls
that followed his noisy roundabouts were a
department of his own providing.</p>

<p>It was late on Tuesday night when the World-Show
established itself in Nevilton Square. The sound of
hammers and the barking of dogs was the last thing
that the villagers heard before they slept, and the
first thing they heard when they awoke.</p>

<p>The master of the World-Show spent the night
according to his custom in solitary regal grandeur
in the largest of his caravans. The sun had not,
however, pierced the white mists in the Nevilton
orchards before Mr. Love was up and abroad. The
first thing he did, on descending the steps of his
caravan, was to wash his hands and face in the basin
of the stone fountain. His next proceeding was to
measure out into a little metal cup which he produced
from his pocket a small quantity of brandy
and to pour this refreshment, diluted with water from
the fountain, down his capacious throat.</p>

<p>Mr. Love was a lean man, of furtive and irascible
appearance. His countenance, bleached by exposure
into a species of motley-coloured leather, shone after
its immersion in the fountain like the knob of a well-worn
cudgel. His whitish hair, cut in convict style
close to his head, emphasized the polished mahogany
of his visage, from the upper portion of which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
sky-blue eyes, small and glittering, shone out defiantly
upon the world, like ominous jewels set in the
forehead of an obscene and smoke-darkened idol.</p>

<p>Having replaced his cup and flask in his pocket,
the master of the World-Show looked anxiously at
the omens of the weather, snuffing the morning breeze
with the air of one not lightly to be fooled either by
rain or shine. Returning to the still silent circus,
he knocked sharply with his knuckles at the door of
the smallest of the three caravans.</p>

<p>“Flick!” he shouted, “let me in! Flick! Old
Flick! Darn ’ee, man, for a blighting sand-louse!
Open the door, God curse you! Old Flick! Old
Flick! Old Flick!”</p>

<p>Thus assaulted, the door of the caravan was opened
from within, and Mr. Love pushed his way into the
interior. A strange enough sight met him when
once inside.</p>

<p>The individual apostrophized as “Old Flick” closed
and bolted the door with extraordinary precaution,
as soon as his master had entered, and then turned
and hovered nervously before him, while Mr. Love
sank down on the only chair in the place. The
caravan was bare of all furniture except a rough
cooking-stove and a three-legged deal table. But it
was at neither of these objects that Job Love stared,
as he tilted back his chair and waved impatiently
aside the deprecatory old man.</p>

<p>Stretched on a ragged horse-blanket upon the floor
lay a sleeping child. Clothed in little else than a
linen bodice and a short flannel petticoat, she turned
restlessly in her slumber under Mr. Love’s scrutiny,
and crossing one bare leg over the other, flung out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
a long white arm, while her dark curls, disturbed by
her movement, fell over her face and hid it from
view.</p>

<p>“Ah!” remarked Mr. Love. “Quieter now, I see.
She must dance today, Flick, and no mistake about it!
You must take her out in the fields this morning,
like you did that other one. I can’t have no more
rampaging and such-like, in my decent circus. But
she must dance, there’s no getting over that,&mdash;she
must dance, Old Flick! ’Twas your own blighting
notion to take her on, remember; and I can’t have no
do-nothing foreigners hanging around, specially now
August be come.</p>

<p>“What did she say her nonsense-name was? Lores,&mdash;Dolores?
Whoever heard tell of such a name as
that?”</p>

<p>The sound of his voice seemed to reach the child
even in her sleep; for flinging her arms over her head,
and turning on her back, she uttered a low indistinguishable
murmur. Her eyes, however, remained
closed, the dark curves of her long eye-lashes contrasting
with the scarlet of her mouth and the ivory
pallor of her skin.</p>

<p>Even Job Love&mdash;though not precisely an æsthete&mdash;was
struck by the girl’s beauty.</p>

<p>“She’ll make a fine dancer, Flick, a fine dancer!
How old dost think she be? ’Bout twelve, or may-be
more, I reckon.</p>

<p>“’Tis pity she won’t speak no Christian word. ’Tis
wonderful, how these foreign childer do hold so
obstinate by their darned fancy-tongue!</p>

<p>“We must trim her out in them spangle-gauzes of
Skipsy Jane. <em>She</em> were the sort of girl to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
boys holler. But this one’ll do well enough, I reckon,
if so be she goes smilin’ and chaffin’ upon the boards.</p>

<p>“But no more of that devil’s foolery, Flick? Dost
hear, man? Take her out into the fields;&mdash;take her
out into the fields! She must dance and she must
smile, all in Skipsy Jane’s spangles, come noon this
day. She must do so, Flick&mdash;or I ain’t Jobie Love!”</p>

<p>The old man paused in his vague moth-like hovering,
and surveyed the outstretched figure. His own
appearance was curious enough to excite a thrill of
intense curiosity, had any less callous eye but that of
his master been cast upon him.</p>

<p>He produced the effect not so much of a living
person, animated by natural impulses, as of a dead
body possessed by some sort of wandering spirit
which made use of him for its own purposes.</p>

<p>If by chance this spirit were to desert him, one
felt that what would be left of Old Flick would be
nothing but the mask of a man,&mdash;a husk, a shard, a
withered stalk, a wisp of dried-up grass! The old
creature was as thin as a lathe; and his cavernous,
colourless eyes and drooping jaw looked, in that
indistinct light, as vague and shadowy as though they
belonged to some phantasmal mirage of mist and
rain drifted in from the sleeping fields.</p>

<p>“How did ’ee ever get Mother Sterner to let ’ee
have so dainty a bit of goods?” went on Mr. Love,
continuing his survey of their unconscious captive.
“The old woman must have been blind-scared of the
police or summat, so as to want to be free of the
maid. ’Tisn’t every day you can pick up a lass so
cut out for the boards as she be.”</p>

<p>At intervals during his master’s discourse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
parchment-like visage of the old man twisted and
contorted itself, as if with the difficulty of finding
words.</p>

<p>When Job Love at last became silent, the words
issued from him as if they had been rustling eddies of
chaff, blown through dried stalks.</p>

<p>“I’ve tried her with one thing, Mister, and I’ve
tried her with another,&mdash;but ’tis no use; she do cry
and cry, and there’s no handling her. I guess I must
take her into them fields, as you do say. ’Tis because
of folks hearing that she do carry on so.”</p>

<p>Job Love frowned and scratched his forehead.</p>

<p>“Damn her,” he cried, “for a limpsy cat! Well&mdash;Old
Flick&mdash;ye picked her up and ye must start her
off. This show don’t begin till nigh along noon,&mdash;so
if ye thinks ye can bring her to reason, some ways
or t’other ways, off with ’ee, my man! Get her a
bite of breakfast first,&mdash;and good luck to ’ee! Only
don’t let’s have no fuss, and don’t let’s have no
onlookers. I’m not the man to stand for any law-breaking.
This show’s a decent show, and Job
Love’s a decent man. If the wench makes trouble,
ye must take her back where she did come from.
Mother Sterner’ll have to slide down. I can’t have
no quarrels with King and Country, over a limpsy
maid like she!”</p>

<p>Uttering these words in a tone of formidable
finality, Mr. Love moved to the entrance and let
himself out.</p>

<p>Their master gone, Old Flick turned waveringly to
the figure on the floor. Taking down a faded coat
from its peg on the wall, he carefully spread it over
the child, tucking it round her body with shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
hands. He then went to the stove in the corner, lit
it, and arranged the kettle. From the stove he
turned to the three-legged table; and removing from
a hanging cupboard a tea-pot, some cups and plates,
a loaf of bread and a pat of butter, he set out these
objects with meticulous nicety, avoiding the least
clatter or sound. This done, he sat down upon the
solitary chair, and waited the boiling of the water with
inscrutable passivity.</p>

<p>From outside the caravan came the shuffle of
stirring feet and the murmur of subdued and drowsy
voices. The camp was beginning to enter upon its
labour of preparation.</p>

<p>When he had made tea, Old Flick touched his
sleeping captive lightly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>The girl started violently, and sat up, with wide-open
eyes. She began talking hurriedly, protesting
and imploring; but not a word of her speech was
intelligible to Old Flick, for the simple reason that it
was Italian,&mdash;Italian of the Neapolitan inflexion.</p>

<p>The old man handed her a strong cup of tea, together
with a large slice of bread-and-butter, uttering
as he did so all manner of soothing and reassuring
words. When she had finished her breakfast he
brought her water and soap.</p>

<p>“Tidy thee-self up, my pretty,” he said. “We be
goin’ out, along into them fields, present.”</p>

<p>Bolting the caravan door on the outside, he shuffled
off to the fountain to perform his own ablutions, and
to assist his companions in unloading the stage-properties,
and setting up the booths and swings.
After the lapse of an hour he climbed the caravan-steps
and re-entered softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span></p>

<p>He found the girl crouched in a corner, her hands
clasped over her knees, and traces of tears upon her
cheeks. Before leaving her, the old man had placed
shoes and stockings by her side, and these she now
wore, together with a dark-coloured skirt and a scarlet
gipsy-shawl.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said. “Thee be goin’ wi’ I into the
fields. Thee be goin’ to learn a dancin’ trick or two.
Show opens along of noon; and Master, he’s goin’ to
let ’ee have Skipsy Jane’s spangles.”</p>

<p>How much of this the child understood it is impossible
to say; but the old man’s tone was not
threatening, and the idea of being taken away&mdash;somewhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;roused
vague hopes in her
soul. She pulled the red shawl over her head and
let him lead her by the hand.</p>

<p>Down the steps they clambered, and hurriedly
threaded their way across the square.</p>

<p>The old man took the road towards Yeoborough,
and turned with the girl up Dead Man’s Lane. He
was but dimly acquainted with the neighbourhood;
but once before, in his wanderings as a pedler, he had
encamped in a certain grassy hollow bordering on the
Auber Woods, and the memory of the seclusion of
this spot drew him now.</p>

<p>As they passed Mr. Quincunx’s garden they encountered
the solitary himself, who, in his sympathy
with Luke Andersen on this particular day, had
resolved to pay the young man an early morning
visit.</p>

<p>The recluse looked with extreme and startled
interest at this singular pair. The child’s beauty
struck him with a shock that almost took his breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
away. There was something about the haunting
expression of her gaze as she turned it upon him that
roused an overpowering flood of tenderness and pity
in untouched abysses of his being.</p>

<p>There must have been some instantaneous reciprocity
in the eccentric man’s grey eyes, for the young
girl turned back after they had passed, and throwing
the shawl away from her head, fixed upon him what
seemed a deliberate and beseeching look of appeal.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx was so completely carried out of his
normal self by this imploring look that he went so
far as to answer its inarticulate prayer by a wave of
his hand, and by a sign that indicated,&mdash;whether
she understood it or not,&mdash;that he intended to render
her assistance.</p>

<p>In his relations with Lacrima Mr. Quincunx was
always remotely conscious that the girl’s character
was stronger than his own, and&mdash;Pariah-like&mdash;this
had the effect of lessening the emotion he felt towards
her.</p>

<p>But now&mdash;in the look of the little Dolores&mdash;there
was an appeal from a weakness and helplessness much
more desperate than his own,&mdash;an appeal to him from
the deepest gulfs of human dependence. The glance
she had given him burned in his brain like a coal of
white fire. It seemed to cry out to him from all the
flotsam and jetsam, all the drift and wreckage of
everything that had ever been drowned, submerged,
and stranded, by the pitilessness of Life, since the
foundation of the world.</p>

<p>The child’s look had indeed the same effect upon
Mr. Quincunx that the look of his Master had upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
the fear-stricken Apostle, in the hall of Caiaphas the
high priest. In one heart-piercing stab it brought to
his overpowered consciousness a vision of all the
victims of cruelty who had ever cried aloud for help
since the generations of men began their tragic
journey.</p>

<p>Perhaps to all extremely sensitive natures of Mr.
Quincunx’s type, a type of morbidly self-conscious
weakness as well as sensitiveness, the electric stir
produced by beauty and sex can only reach a culmination
when the medium of its appearance approximates
to the extreme limit of fragility and helplessness.</p>

<p>Hell itself, so to speak, had to display to him its
span-long babes, before he could be aroused to descend
and “harrow” it! But once roused in him, this
latent spirit of the pitiful Son of Man became formidable,
reckless, irresistible. The very absence in him
of the usual weight of human solidity and “character”
made him the more porous to this divine mood.</p>

<p>Anyone who watched him returning hastily to his
cottage from the garden-gate would have been amazed
by the change in his countenance. He looked and
moved like a man under a blinding illumination. So
must the citizen of Tarsus have looked, when he
staggered into the streets of Damascus.</p>

<p>He literally ran into his kitchen, snatched up his
hat and stick, poured a glass of milk down his throat,
put a couple of biscuits into his pocket, and re-issued,
ready for his strange pursuit. He hurried up the
lane to the first gate that offered itself, and passing
into the field continued the chase on the further side
of the hedge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man evidently found the hill something
of an effort, for it was not long before Mr. Quincunx
overtook them.</p>

<p>He passed them by unremarked, and continued his
advance along the hedgerow till he reached the
summit of the ridge between Wild Pine and Seven
Ashes. Here, concealed behind a clump of larches,
he awaited their approach. To his surprise, they
entered one of the fields on the opposite side of the
road, and began walking across it.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx watched them. In a corner of the
field they were crossing lay a spacious hollow,&mdash;once
the bed of a pond,&mdash;but now quite dry and overgrown
with moss and clover.</p>

<p>Old Flick’s instinct led him to this spot, as one
well adapted to the purpose he had in mind, both by
reason of its absolute seclusion and by reason of its
smooth turf-floor.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx waited till their two figures vanished
into this declivity, and then he himself crossed the
field in their track.</p>

<p>Having reached the mossy level of the vanished
pond,&mdash;a place which seemed as though Nature herself
had designed it with a view to his present intention,&mdash;Old
Flick assumed a less friendly air towards
his captive. A psychologist interested in searching
out the obscure workings of derelict and submerged
souls, would have come to the speedy conclusion as
he watched the old man’s cadaverous face that the
spirit which at present animated his corpse-like body
was one that had little commiseration or compunction
in it.</p>

<p>The young Dolores had not, it seemed, to deal at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
this moment with an ordinary human scoundrel, but
with a faded image of humanity galvanized into life
by some conscienceless Larva.</p>

<p>In proportion as this unearthly obsession grew upon
Old Flick, his natural countenance grew more and
more dilapidated and withered. Innumerable years
seemed suddenly added to the burden he already
carried. The lines of his face assumed a hideous and
Egyptian immobility; only his eyes, as he turned them
upon his companion, were no longer colourless.</p>

<p>“Doll,” said he, “now thee must try thee’s steps,
or ’twill be the worse for thee!”</p>

<p>The girl only answered by flinging herself down on
her knees before him, and pouring forth unintelligible
supplications.</p>

<p>“No more o’ this,” cried the old man; “no more o’
this! I’ve got to learn ’ee to dance,&mdash;and learn ’ee
to dance I will. Ye’ll have to go on them boards
come noon, whether ’ee will or no!”</p>

<p>The child only clasped her hands more tightly
together, and renewed her pleading.</p>

<p>It would have needed the genius of some supreme
painter, and of such a painter in an hour of sheer
insanity, to have done justice to the extraordinary
expression that crossed the countenance of Old Flick
at that moment. The outlines of his face seemed to
waver and decompose. None but an artist who had,
like the insatiable Leonardo, followed the very dead
into their forlorn dissolution, could have indicated
the setting of his eyes; and his eyes themselves,
madness alone could have depicted.</p>

<p>With a sudden vicious jerk the old man snatched
the shawl from the girl’s shoulders, flung it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
ground, and seizing her by the wrists pulled her up
upon her feet.</p>

<p>“Dance, ye baggage!” he cried hoarsely;&mdash;“dance,
I tell ’ee!”</p>

<p>It was plain that the luckless waif understood
clearly enough now what was required of her, and it
was also plain that she recognized that the moment
for supplication had gone by. She stepped back a
pace or two upon the smooth turf, and slipping off
her unlaced shoes,&mdash;shoes far too large for her small
feet,&mdash;she passed the back of her hand quickly
across her eyes, shook her hair away from her forehead,
and began a slow, pathetic little dance.</p>

<p>“Higher!” cried Old Flick in an excited voice,
beating the air with his hand and humming a strange
snatch of a tune that might have inspired the dances
of Polynesian cannibals. “Higher, I tell ’ee!”</p>

<p>The girl felt compelled to obey; and putting one
hand on her hip and lifting up her skirt with the
other, she proceeded, shyly and in forlorn silence, to
dance an old Neapolitan folk-dance, such as might be
witnessed, on any summer evening, by the shores of
Amalfi or Sorrento.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Mr. Quincunx made his
appearance against the sky-line above them. He
looked for one brief second at the girl’s bare arms,
waving curls, and light-swinging body, and then leapt
down between them.</p>

<p>All nervousness, all timidity, seemed to have fallen
away from him like a snake’s winter-skin under the
spring sun. He seized the child’s hand with an air
of indescribable gentleness and authority, and made
so menacing and threatening a gesture that Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
Flick, staggering backwards, nearly fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Whose child is this?” he demanded sternly,
soothing the frightened little dancer with one hand,
while with the other he shook his cane in the direction
of the gasping and protesting old man.</p>

<p>“Whose child is this? You’ve stolen her, you old
rascal! You’re no Italian,&mdash;anyone can see that!
You’re a damned old tramp, and if you weren’t so
old and ugly I’d beat you to death; do you hear?&mdash;to
death, you villain! Whose child is she? Can’t
you speak? Take care; I’m badly tempted to make
you taste this,&mdash;to make <em>you</em> skip and dance a little!</p>

<p>“What do you say? Job Love’s circus? Well,&mdash;he’s
not an Italian either, is he? So if you haven’t
stolen her, he has.”</p>

<p>He turned to the child, stooping over her with
infinite tenderness, and folding the shawl of which she
had again possessed herself, with hands as gentle as a
mother’s, about her shoulders and head.</p>

<p>“Where are your parents, my darling?” he asked,
adding with a flash of amazing presence of mind,&mdash;“your
‘padre’ and ‘madre’?”</p>

<p>The girl seemed to get the drift of the question, and
with a pitiful little smile pointed earthward, and
made a sweeping gesture with both her hands, as if
to indicate the passing of death’s wings.</p>

<p>“Dead?&mdash;both dead, eh?” muttered Mr. Quincunx.
“And these rascals who’ve got hold of you
are villains and rogues? Damned rogues! Damned
villains!”</p>

<p>He paused and muttered to himself. “What the
devil’s the Italian for a god-forsaken rascal?&mdash;‘Cattivo!’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
‘Tutto cattivo!’&mdash;the whole lot of
them a set of confounded scamps!”</p>

<p>The child nodded her head vigorously.</p>

<p>“You see,” he cried, turning to Old Flick, “she
disowns you all. This is clearly a most knavish
piece of work! What were you doing to the child?
eh? eh? eh?” Mr. Quincunx accompanied these final
syllables with renewed flourishes of his stick in the air.</p>

<p>Old Flick retreated still further away, his legs
shaking under him. “Here,&mdash;you can clear out of
this! Do you understand? You can clear out of
this; and go back to your damned master, and tell
him I’m going to send the police after him!</p>

<p>“As for this girl, I’m going to take her home with
me. So off you go,&mdash;you old reprobate; and thankful
you may be that I haven’t broken every bone in
your body! I’ve a great mind to do it now. Upon
my soul I’ve a great mind to do it!</p>

<p>“Shall I beat him into a jelly for you,&mdash;my darling?
Shall I make him skip and dance for you?”</p>

<p>The child seemed to understand his gestures, if not
his words; for she clung passionately to his hands, and
pressing them to her lips, covered them with kisses;
shaking her head at the same time, as much as to
say, “Old Flick is nothing. Let Old Flick go to the
devil, as long as I can stay with you!” In some such
manner as this, at any rate, Mr. Quincunx interpreted
her words.</p>

<p>“Sheer off, then, you old scoundrel! Shog off back
to your confounded circus! And when you’ve got
there, tell your friends,&mdash;Job Love and his gang,&mdash;that
if they want this little one they’d better come
and fetch her!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dead Man’s Lane,&mdash;that’s where I live. It’s
easily enough found; and so is the police-station in
Yeoborough,&mdash;as you and your damned kidnappers
shall discover before you’ve done with me!”</p>

<p>Uttering these words in a voice so menacing that
the old man shook like an aspen-leaf, Mr. Quincunx
took the girl by the hand, and, ascending the grassy
slope, walked off with her across the field.</p>

<p>Old Flick seemed reduced to a condition bordering
upon imbecility. He staggered up out of that
unpropitious hollow, and stood stock-still, like one
petrified, until they were out of sight. Then, very
slowly and mumbling incoherently to himself, he made
his way back towards the village.</p>

<p>He did not even turn his head as he passed Mr.
Quincunx’s cottage. Indeed, it is extremely doubtful
how far he had recognized him as the person they
encountered on their way, and still more doubtful
how far he had heard or understood, when the tenant
of Dead Man’s Lane indicated the place of his abode.</p>

<p>The sudden transformation of the timid recluse
into a formidable man of action did not end with his
triumphant retirement to his familiar domain. Some
mysterious fibre in his complicated temperament had
been struck, and continued to be struck, by the little
Dolores, which not only rendered him indifferent to
personal danger, but willing and happy to encounter
it.</p>

<p>The event only added one more proof to the sage
dictum of the Chinese philosopher,&mdash;that you can
never tell of what a man is capable until he is stone-dead.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="smaller">VARIOUS ENCOUNTERS</span></h2>

<p>During the hours when Mr. Quincunx was
undergoing this strange experience, several
other human brains under the roofs of Nevilton
were feeling the pressure of extreme perturbation.</p>

<p>Gladys, after a gloomy breakfast, which was
rendered more uncomfortable, not only by her father’s
chaffing references to the approaching ceremony,
but by a letter from Dangelis, had escaped to her
room to be assisted by Lacrima in dressing for the
confirmation.</p>

<p>In his letter the artist declared his intention of
spending that night at the Gloucester Hotel in Weymouth,
and begged his betrothed to forgive this delay
in his return to her side.</p>

<p>This communication caused Gladys many tremors
of disquietude. Could it be possible that the American
had found out something and that he had gone
to Weymouth to meditate at leisure upon his course
of action?</p>

<p>In any case this intimation of a delay in his return
irritated the girl. It struck her in her tenderest spot.
It was a direct flouting of her magnetic power. It
was an insult to her sex-vanity.</p>

<p>She had seen nothing of Luke since their Sunday’s
excursion; and as Lacrima, with cold submissive
fingers, helped her to arrange her white dress and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
virginal veil, she could hear the sound of the bell
tolling for James Andersen’s funeral.</p>

<p>Mingled curiously enough with this melancholy
vibration falling at protracted intervals upon the air,
like the stroke of some reiterated hammer of doom,
came another sound, a sound of a completely opposite
character,&mdash;the preluding strains, namely, of the
steam roundabouts of Porter’s Universal Show.</p>

<p>It was as though on one side of the village the
angel of death were striking an iron-threatening gong,
while, on the other side, the demons of life were
howling a brazen defiance.</p>

<p>The association of the two sounds as they reached
her at this critical hour brought the figure of Luke
vividly and obsessingly into her mind. How well she
knew the sort of comment he would make upon the
bizarre combination! Beneath the muslin frills of
her virginal dress,&mdash;a dress that made her look fairer
and younger than usual,&mdash;her heart ached with sick
longing for her evasive lover.</p>

<p>The wheel had indeed come full circle for the fair-haired
girl. She could not help the thought recurring
again and again, as Lacrima’s light fingers adjusted
her veil, that the next time she dressed in this manner
it would be for her wedding-day. Her one profound
consolation lay in the knowledge that her cousin,
even more deeply than herself, dreaded the approach
of that fatal Thursday.</p>

<p>Her hatred for the pale-cheeked Italian re-accumulated
every drop of its former venom, as with an air
of affectionate gratitude she accepted her assistance.</p>

<p>It is a psychological peculiarity of certain human
beings that the more they hate, the more they crave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
with a curious perverted instinct, some sort of physical
contact with the object of their hatred.</p>

<p>Every touch of Lacrima’s hand increased the
intensity of Gladys’ loathing; and yet, so powerful is
the instinct to which I refer, she lost no opportunity
of accentuating the contact between them, letting
their fingers meet again and again, and even their
breath, and throwing back her rounded chin to make
it easier for those hated wrists to busy themselves
about her throat. Her general air was an air of
playful passivity; but at one moment, imprinting a kiss
on the girl’s arm as, in the process of arranging her
veil, it brushed across her cheek, she seemed almost
anxious to convey to Lacrima the full implication of
her real feeling.</p>

<p>Never has a human caress been so electric with the
vibrations of antipathy, as was that kiss. She followed
up this signal of animosity by a series of feline
taunts relative to John Goring, one of which, from
its illuminated insight into the complex strata of the
girl’s soul, delighted her by its effect.</p>

<p>Lacrima winced under it, as if under the sting of a
lash, and a burning flood of scarlet suffused her
cheeks. She dropped her hands and stepped back,
uttering a fierce vow that nothing&mdash;nothing on
earth&mdash;would induce her to accompany a girl who
could say such things, to such a ceremony!</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t,&mdash;I wouldn’t!” cried Gladys
mockingly. “I wouldn’t dream of coming with me!
Tomorrow week, anyway, we’re bound to go to church
side by side. Father wanted to drive with me then,
you know, and to let mother go with you,&mdash;but I
wouldn’t hear of it! I said they must go in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>
carriage, and you and I in another, so that our last
drive together we should be quite by ourselves.
You’ll like that, won’t you, darling?”</p>

<p>Lacrima’s only answer to this was to turn her back
to her cousin, and begin putting on her hat and
gloves.</p>

<p>“I know where you’re going,” said Gladys. “You’re
going to see your dear Maurice. Give him my love!
I should be ashamed to let such a wretched coward
come near me.</p>

<p>“James&mdash;poor boy!&mdash;was a fellow of a different
metal. He’d some spirit in him. Listen! When that
bell stops tolling they’ll be carrying him into the
church. I expect you’re thinking now, darling, that
it would have been better if you’d treated him
differently. Of course you know it’s you that killed
him? Oh, nobody else! Just little Lacrima and her
coy, demure ways!</p>

<p>“<em>I’ve</em> never killed a man. I can say that, at all
events.</p>

<p>“That’s right! Run off to her dear Maurice,&mdash;her
dear brave Maurice! Perhaps he’ll take her on
his knees again, and she’ll play the sweet little innocent,&mdash;like
that day when I peeped through the
window!”</p>

<p>This final dart had hardly reached its objective
before Lacrima without attempting any retort rushed
from the room.</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> go and see Maurice. I will! I will!” she
murmured to herself as she ran down the broad oak
staircase, and slipped out by the East door.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with these events, a scene of equal
dramatic intensity, though of a very different character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
was being enacted in the vicarage drawing-room.</p>

<p>Vennie, as we have noted, had resolved to postpone
for the present her reception into the Catholic Church.
She had also resolved that nothing on earth should
induce her to reveal to her mother her change of
creed until the thing was an accomplished fact. The
worst, however, of the kind of mental suppression in
which she had been living of late, is that it tends to
produce a volcanic excitement of the nerves, liable at
any moment to ungovernable upheavals. Quite little
things&mdash;mere straws and bagatelles&mdash;are enough to
set this eruption beginning; and when once it begins,
the accumulated passion of the long days of fermentation
gives the explosion a horrible force.</p>

<p>One perpetual annoyance to Vennie was her
mother’s persistent fondness for family prayers. It
seemed to the girl as though Valentia insisted on this
performance, not so much out of a desire to serve
God, as out of a sense of what was due to herself as
the mistress of a well-conducted establishment.</p>

<p>Vennie always fancied she discerned a peculiar
tone of self-satisfaction in her mother’s voice, as,
rather loudly, and extremely clearly, she read her
liturgical selections to the assembled servants.</p>

<p>On this particular morning the girl had avoided
the performance of this rite, by leaving her room
earlier than usual and taking refuge in the furthest
of the vicarage orchards. Backwards and forwards
she walked, in that secluded place, with her hands
behind her and her head bent, heedless of the drenching
dew which covered every grass-blade and of the
heavy white mists that still hung about the tree-trunks.
She was obliged to return to her room and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
change her shoes and stockings before joining her
mother at breakfast, but not before she had prayed
a desperate prayer, down there among the misty trees,
for the eternal rest of James Andersen’s soul.</p>

<p>This little incident of her absence from prayers
was the direct cause of the unfortunate scene that
followed.</p>

<p>Valentia hardly spoke to her daughter while the
meal proceeded, and when at last it was over, she
retired to the drawing-room and began writing letters.</p>

<p>This was an extremely ill-omened sign to anyone
who knew Mrs. Seldom’s habits. Under normal
conditions, her first proceeding after breakfast was to
move to the kitchen, where she engaged in a long
culinary debate with both cook and gardener; a course
of action which was extremely essential, as without it,&mdash;so
bitter was the feud between these two worthies,&mdash;it
is unlikely that there would have been any vegetables
at all, either for lunch or dinner. When anything
occurred to throw her into a mood of especially good
spirits, she would pass straight out of the French
window on to the front lawn, and armed with a pair
of formidable garden-scissors would make a selection
of flowers and leaves appropriate to a festival temper.</p>

<p>But this adjournment at so early an hour to the
task of letter-writing indicated that Valentia was in a
condition of mind, which in anyone but a lady of her
distinction and breeding could have been called nothing
less than a furious rage. For of all things in the
world, Mrs. Seldom most detested this business of
writing letters; and therefore,&mdash;with that perverse
self-punishing instinct, which is one of the most
artful weapons of offence given to refined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
gentlewomen,&mdash;she took grim satisfaction in setting herself
down to write; thus producing chaos in the kitchen,
where the gardener refused to obey the cook, and
miserable remorse in the heart of Vennie, who wandered
up and down the lawn meditating a penitential
apology.</p>

<p>Satisfied in her heart that she was causing universal
annoyance and embarrassment by her proceeding,
and yet quite confident that there was nothing but
what was proper and natural in her writing letters
at nine o’clock in the morning, Valentia began, by
gentle degrees, to recover her lost temper.</p>

<p>The only real sedative to thoroughly aggravated
nerves, is the infliction of similar aggravation upon
the nerves of others. This process is like the laying
on of healing ointment; and the more extended the
disturbance which we have the good fortune to create,
the sooner we ourselves recover our equanimity.</p>

<p>Valentia had already cast several longing glances
through the window at the heavy sunshine falling
mistily on the asters and petunias, and in another
moment she would probably have left her letter and
joined her daughter in the garden, had not Vennie
anticipated any such movement by entering the room
herself.</p>

<p>“I ought to make you understand, mother,” the
girl began as soon as she stepped in, speaking in that
curious strained voice which people assume when they
have worked themselves up to a pitch of nervous
excitement, “that when I don’t appear at prayers, it
isn’t because I’m in a sulky temper, or in any mad
haste to get out of doors. It’s&mdash;it’s for a different
reason.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span></p>

<p>Valentia gazed at her in astonishment. The tone
in which Vennie spoke was so tense, her eyes shone
with such a strange brilliance, and her look was altogether
so abnormal, that Mrs. Seldom completely
forgot her injured priestess-vanity, and waited in
sheer maternal alarm for the completion of the girl’s
announcement.</p>

<p>“It’s because I’ve made up my mind to become a
Catholic, and Catholics aren’t allowed to attend any
other kind of service than their own.”</p>

<p>Valentia rose to her feet and looked at her daughter
in blank dismay. Her first feeling was one of overpowering
indignation against Mr. Taxater, to whose
treacherous influence she felt certain this madness
was mainly due.</p>

<p>There was a terrible pause during which Vennie,
leaning against the back of a chair, was conscious that
both herself and her mother were trembling from
head to foot. The soft murmur of wood-pigeons
wafted in from the window, was now blended with
two other sounds, the sound of the tolling of the
church-bell and the sound of the music of Mr.
Love’s circus, testing the efficiency of its roundabouts.</p>

<p>“So this is what it has come to, is it?” said the
old lady at last. “And I suppose the next thing
you’ll tell me, in this unkind, inconsiderate way, is
that you’ve decided to become a nun!”</p>

<p>Vennie made a little movement with her head.</p>

<p>“You have?” cried Valentia, pale with anger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
“You have made up your mind to do that? Well&mdash;I
wouldn’t have believed it of you, Vennie! In spite
of everything I’ve done for you; in spite of everything
I’ve taught you; in spite of everything I’ve prayed
for;&mdash;you can go and do this! Oh, you’re an unkind,
ungrateful girl! But I know that look on your face.
I’ve known it from your childhood. When you look
like that there’s no hope of moving you. Go on,
then! Do as you wish to do. Leave your mother in
her old age, and destroy the last hope of our family.
I won’t speak another word. I know nothing I can
say will change you.” She sank down upon the
chintz-covered sofa and covered her face with her
hands.</p>

<p>Vennie cursed herself for her miserable want of
tact. What demon was it that had tempted her to
break her resolution? Then, suddenly, as she looked
at her mother swaying to and fro on the couch, a
strange impulse of hard inflexible obstinacy rose up
in her.</p>

<p>These wretched human affections,&mdash;so unbalanced
and selfish,&mdash;what a relief to escape from them
altogether! Like the passing on its way, across a
temperate ocean, of some polar iceberg, there drove,
at that moment, through Vennie’s consciousness, a
wedge of frozen, adamantine contempt for all these
human, too-human clingings and clutchings which
would fain imprison the spirit and hold it down with
soft-strangling hands.</p>

<p>In her deepest heart she turned almost savagely
away from this grey-haired woman, sitting there so
hurt in her earthly affections and ambitions. She
uttered a fierce mental invocation to that other
Mother,&mdash;her whose heart, pierced by seven swords,
had submitted to God’s will without a groan!</p>

<p>Valentia, who, it must be remembered, had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
only married a Seldom, but was herself one of that
breed, felt at that moment as though this girl of
hers were reverting to some mad strain of Pre-Elizabethan
fanaticism. There was something mediæval
about Vennie’s obstinacy, as there was something
mediæval about the lines of her face. Valentia
recalled a portrait she had once seen of an ancestor
of theirs in the days before the Reformation. He, the
great Catholic Baron, had possessed the same thin
profile and the same pinched lips. It was a curious
revenge, the poor lady thought, for those evicted
Cistercians, out of whose plundered house the Nevilton
mansion had been built, that this fate, of all
fates, should befall the last of the Seldoms!</p>

<p>The tolling of the bell, which hitherto had gone on,
monotonously and insistently, across the drowsy
lawn, suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>Vennie started and ran hurriedly to the door.</p>

<p>“They are burying James Andersen,” she cried,
“and I ought to be there. It would look unkind and
thoughtless of me not to be there. Good-bye, mother!
We’ll talk of this when I come back. I’m sorry to
be so unsatisfactory a daughter to you, but perhaps
you’ll feel differently some day.”</p>

<p>Left to herself, Valentia Seldom rose and went back
to her letter. But the pen fell from her limp fingers,
and tears stained the already written page.</p>

<p>The funeral service had only just commenced when
Vennie reached the churchyard. She remained at the
extreme outer edge of the crowd, where groups of
inquisitive women are wont to cluster, wearing their
aprons and carrying their babies, and where the bigger
children are apt to be noisy and troublesome. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
caught a glimpse of Ninsy Lintot among those standing
quite close to where Mr. Clavering, in his white
surplice, was reading the pregnant liturgical words.
She noticed that the girl held her hands to her face
and that her slender form was shaking with the stress
of her emotion.</p>

<p>She could not see Luke’s face, but she was conscious
that his motionless figure had lost its upright grace.
The young stone-carver seemed to droop, like a
sun-flower whose stalk has been bent by the wind.</p>

<p>The words of the familiar English service were
borne intermittently to her ears as they fell from the
lips of the priest who had once been her friend. It
struck her poignantly enough,&mdash;that brave human
defiance, so solemn and tender, with which humanity
seems to rise up in sublime desperation and hoist its
standard of hope against hope!</p>

<p>She wondered what the sceptical Luke was feeling
all this while. When Mr. Clavering began to read the
passage which is prefaced in the Book of Common
Prayer by the words, “Then while the earth be cast
upon the Body by some standing by, the priest shall
say,”&mdash;the quiet sobs of poor little Ninsy broke
into a wail of passionate grief, grief to which Vennie,
for all her convert’s aloofness from Protestant heresy,
could not help adding her own tears.</p>

<p>It was the custom at Nevilton for the bearers of
the coffin, when the service was over, to re-form in
solemn procession, and escort the chief mourners back
to the house from which they had come. It was her
knowledge of this custom that led Vennie to steal
away before the final words were uttered; and her
hurried departure from the churchyard saved her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>
from being a witness of the somewhat disconcerting
event with which the solemn transaction closed.</p>

<p>The bringing of James’ body to the church had
been unfortunately delayed at the start by the
wayward movements of a luggage-train, which persisted
in shunting up and down over the level-crossing,
at the moment when they were carrying the coffin from
the house. This delay had been followed by others,
owing to various unforeseen causes, and by the time
the service actually began it was already close upon
the hour fixed for the confirmation.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that, soon after Vennie’s departure,
at the very moment when the procession of
bearers, followed by Luke and the station-master’s
wife, issued forth into the street, there drove up to
the church-door a two-horsed carriage containing
Gladys and her mother, the former all whitely veiled,
as if she were a child-bride. Seeing the bearers troop
by, the fair-haired candidate for confirmation clutched
Mrs. Romer’s arm and held her in her place, but
leaning forward in the effort of this movement she
presented her face at the carriage window, just as
Luke himself emerged from the gates.</p>

<p>The two young people found themselves looking
one another straight in the eyes, until with a shuddering
spasm that shook her whole frame, Gladys sank
back into her seat, as if from the effect of a crushing
blow received full upon the breast.</p>

<p>Luke passed on, following the bearers, with something
like the ghost of a smile upon his drawn and
contorted lips.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="smaller">VENNIE SELDOM</span></h2>

<p>It was not towards her mother’s house that
Vennie directed her steps when she left the
churchyard. She turned sharp to the west, and
walked rapidly down the central street of the village
into the square at the end of it.</p>

<p>Here she found an arena of busy and stirring
confusion, dominated by hissing spouts of steam,
hoarse whistlings from the “roundabout” engines, and
occasional bursts of extravagant melody, as the
circus-men made their musical experiments, pending
the opening of the show.</p>

<p>Vennie’s intention, in crossing the square, was to
pay a morning visit to Mr. Quincunx, whose absence
from Andersen’s funeral had struck her mind as
extraordinary and ominous. She feared that the
recluse must be ill. Nothing less than illness, she
thought, would have kept him away from such an
event. She knew how closely he and the younger
stone-carver were associated, and it was inconceivable
that any insane jealousy of the dead could have held
him at home. Of course it was possible that he had
been compelled to go to work at Yeoborough as usual,
but she did not think this likely.</p>

<p>It was, however, not only anxiety lest her mother’s
queer friend should be ill that actuated her. She
felt,&mdash;now that her ultimatum had been delivered,&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
the sooner she entered the Catholic Church and
plunged into her novitiate, the better it would be.
When events had <em>happened</em>, Mrs. Seldom accepted
them. It was during the days of uncertain waiting
that her nerves broke down. Once the daughter
were actually a postulant in a convent, she felt sure
the mother would resign herself, and resume her
normal life.</p>

<p>Valentia was a very independent and self-sufficient
woman. With her favourite flowers and her favourite
biographies of proconsular personages, the girl felt
convinced she would be much less heart-broken than
she imagined.</p>

<p>Her days in Nevilton being thus numbered, Vennie
could not help giving way to a desire that had lately
grown more and more definite within her, to have a
bold and unhesitating interview with Mr. Quincunx.
Perhaps even at this last hour something might be
done to save Lacrima from her fate!</p>

<p>Passing along the outskirts of the circus, she could
not resist pausing for a moment to observe the numerous
groups of well-known village characters, whom
curiosity had drawn to the spot.</p>

<p>She was amazed to catch sight of the redoubtable
Mr. Wone, holding one of his younger children by
the hand and surveying with extreme interest the
setting up of a colossal framework of gilded and
painted wood, destined to support certain boat-shaped
swings. She felt a little indignant with the
worthy man for not having been present at Andersen’s
funeral, but the naive and childlike interest with
which, with open mouth and eyes, he stood gaping at
this glittering erection, soothed her anger into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span>
smile. He really was a good sort of man, this poor
Wone! She wondered vaguely whether he intended
himself to indulge in the pastime of swinging in a
boat-shaped swing or whirling round upon a wooden
horse. She felt that if she could see him on one of
these roundabouts,&mdash;especially if he retained that
expression of guileless admiration,&mdash;she could really
forgive him everything.</p>

<p>She caught a glimpse of two other figures whose
interest in the proceedings appeared extremely vivid,
no less persons than Mr. John Goring and his devoted
henchman, Bert Leerd. These two were
engaged in reading a glaring advertisement which depicted
a young woman clad in astounding spangles
dancing on a tight-rope, and it was difficult to say
whether the farmer or the idiot was the more
absorbed.</p>

<p>She was just turning away, when she heard herself
called by name, and from amid a crowd of women
clustering round one of Mr. Love’s bric-a-brac stalls,
there came towards her, together, Mrs. Fringe and
Mrs. Wotnot.</p>

<p>Vennie was extremely surprised to find these two
ladies,&mdash;by no means particularly friendly as a rule,&mdash;thus
joined in partnership of dissipation, but she
supposed the influence of a circus, like the influence
of religion, has a dissolvent effect upon human animosity.
That these excellent women should have
preferred the circus, however, to the rival entertainment
in the churchyard, did strike her mind as extraordinary.
She did not know that they had, as a
matter of fact, “eaten their pot of honey” at the
one, before proceeding, post-haste, to enjoy the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span></p>

<p>“May we walk with you, miss, a step?” supplicated
Mrs. Fringe, as Vennie indicated her intention
of moving on, as soon as their salutations were
over.</p>

<p>“Thank you, you are very kind, Mrs. Fringe.
Perhaps,&mdash;a little way, but I’m rather busy this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh we shan’t trouble you long,” murmured Mrs.
Wotnot, “It’s only,&mdash;well, Mrs. Fringe, here, had
better speak.”</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Vennie began her advance
up the Yeoborough road supported by the two housekeepers,
the lean one on the left of her, and the fat
one on the right of her.</p>

<p>“Will I tell her, or will you tell her?” murmured
the plump lady sweetly, when they were clear of the
village.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wotnot made a curious grimace and clasped
and unclasped her hands.</p>

<p>“Better you; much, much better, that it should
be you,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“But ’twas thy tale, dearie; ’twas thy tale and
surprisin’ discoverin’s,” protested Mrs. Fringe.</p>

<p>“Those that knows aren’t always those that tells,”
observed the other sententiously.</p>

<p>“But you do think it’s proper and right the young
lady should know?” said Mr. Clavering’s housekeeper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wotnot nodded. “If ’taint too shameful for
her, ’tis best what she’d a’ ought to hear,” said the
lean woman.</p>

<p>Vennie became conscious at this moment that
whenever Mrs. Wotnot opened her mouth there
issued thence a most unpleasant smell of brandy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
it flashed upon her that this was the explanation of
the singular converging of these antipodal orbits. In
the absence of her master, Mrs. Wotnot had evidently
“taken to drink,” and it was doubtless out of her
protracted intoxication that Mrs. Fringe had derived
whatever scandalous piece of gossip it was that she
was now so anxious to impart.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ’ee, miss,” said Mrs. Fringe, “with no
nonsense-fangles and no shilly-shally. I’ll tell ’ee
straight out and sober,&mdash;same as our dear friend
did tell it to me. ’Tis along of Miss Romer,&mdash;ye
be to understand, wot is to be confirmed this same
blessed day.</p>

<p>“The dear woman, here, was out a-gatherin’ laurel-leaves
one fine evenin’, long o’ some weeks since, and
who should she get wind of, in the bushes near-by,
but Mr. Luke and Miss Gladys. I been my own self
ere now, moon-daft on that there lovely young man,
but Satan’s ways be Satan’s ways, and none shall
report that I takes countenance of <em>such</em> goings on.
Mrs. Wotnot here, she heerd every Jack word them
sinful young things did say,&mdash;and shameful-awful
their words were, God in Heaven do know!</p>

<p>“They were cursin’ one another, like to split, that
night. She were cryin’ and fandanderin’ and he
were laughin’ and chaffin’. ’Twas God’s terror to hear
how they went on, with the holy bare sky over their
shameless heads!”</p>

<p>“Tell the young lady quick and plain,” ejaculated
Mrs. Wotnot at this point, clutching Vennie’s arm
and arresting their advance.</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> ’a tellin’ her,” retorted Mrs. Fringe, “I’m
a tellin’ as fast as my besom can breathe. Don’t ’ee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
push a body so! The young lady ain’t in such a
tantrum-hurry as all that.”</p>

<p>“I am <em>rather</em> anxious to get on with my walk,”
threw in Vennie, looking from one to another with
some embarrassment, “and I really don’t care very
much about hearing things of this kind.”</p>

<p>“Tell ’er! Tell ’er! Tell ’er!” cried Mrs. Wotnot.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fringe cast a contemptuous look at her rival
housekeeper.</p>

<p>“Our friend baint quite her own self today, miss,”
she remarked with a wink at Vennie, “the weather
or summat’ ’ave moved ’er rheumatiz from ’er legs,
and settled it in ’er stummick.”</p>

<p>“Tell her! Tell her!” reiterated the other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fringe lowered her voice to a pregnant
whisper.</p>

<p>“The truth be, miss, that our friend here heered
these wicked young things talk quite open-like about
their gay goings on. So plain did they talk, that
all wot the Blessed Lord ’is own self do know, of
such as most folks keeps to ’emselves, went burnin’
and shamin’ into our friend’s ’stonished ears. And wot
she did gather was that Miss Gladys, for certin’ and
sure, be a lost girl, and Mr. Luke ’as ’ad ’is bit of
fun down to the uttermost drop.”</p>

<p>The extraordinary solemnity with which Mrs.
Fringe uttered these words and the equally extraordinary
solemnity with which Mrs. Wotnot nodded
her head in corroboration of their truth had a devastating
effect upon Vennie. There was no earthly
reason why these two females should have invented
this squalid story. Mrs. Fringe was an incurable
scandal-monger, but Vennie had never found her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span>
liar. Besides there was a genuine note of shocked
sincerity about her tone which no mere morbid suspicion
could have evoked.</p>

<p>The thing was true then! Gladys and Luke were
lovers, in the most extreme sense of that word, and
Dangelis was the victim of an outrageous betrayal.</p>

<p>Vennie had sufficient presence of mind to avoid the
eyes of both the women, eyes fixed with ghoulish and
lickerish interest upon her, as they watched for the
effect of this revelation,&mdash;but she was uncomfortably
conscious that her cheeks were flaming and her voice
strained as she bade them good-bye. Comment, of
any kind, upon what they had revealed to her she
found absolutely impossible. She could only wish
them a pleasant time at the circus if they were
returning thither, and freedom from any ill effects
due to their accompanying her so far.</p>

<p>When she was alone, and beginning to climb the
ascent of Dead Man’s Lane, the full implication of
what she had learnt thrust itself through her brain
like a red-hot wedge. Vennie’s experience of the
treacherousness of the world had, as we know, gone
little deeper than her reaction from the rough discourtesy
of Mr. Clavering and the evasive aloofness
of Mr. Taxater. This sudden revelation into the
brutishness and squalour inherent in our planetary
system had the effect upon her of an access of physical
nausea. She felt dizzy and sick, as she toiled up the
hill, between the wet sun-pierced hedges, and under
the heavy September trees.</p>

<p>The feeling of autumn in the air, so pleasant under
normal conditions to human senses, seemed to associate
itself just now with this dreadful glance she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
had had into the basic terrors of things. The whole
atmosphere about her seemed to smell of decay, of
decomposition, of festering mortality. The pull and
draw of the thick Nevilton soil, its horrible demonic
gravitation, had never got hold of her more tenaciously
than it did then. She felt as though some
vast octopus-like tentacles were dragging her earthward.</p>

<p>Vennie was one of those rare women for whom,
even under ordinary conditions, the idea of sex is
distasteful and repulsive. Presented to her as it was
now, mingled with treachery and deception, it obsessed
her with an almost living presence. Sensuality
had always been for her the one unpardonable sin,
and sensuality of this kind, turning the power of sex
into a mere motive for squalid pleasure-seeking, filled
her with a shuddering disgust.</p>

<p>So this was what men and women were like! This
was the kind of thing that went on, under the “covert
and convenient seeming” of affable lies!</p>

<p>The whole of nature seemed to have become, in
one moment, foul and miasmic. Rank vapours rose
from the ground at her feet, and the weeds in the
hedge took odious and indecent shapes.</p>

<p>An immense wave of distrust swept over her for
everyone that she knew. Was Mr. Clavering himself
like this?</p>

<p>This thought,&mdash;the thought of what, for all she
could tell, might exist between her priest-friend and
this harlot-girl,&mdash;flushed her cheeks with a new
emotion. Mixed at that moment with her virginal
horror of the whole squalid business, was a pang of
quite a different character, a pang that approached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>
if it did not reach, the sharp sting of sheer physical
jealousy.</p>

<p>As soon as she became aware of this feeling in
herself it sickened her with a deeper loathing. Was
she also contaminated, like the rest? Was no living
human being free from this taint?</p>

<p>She stopped and passed her hand across her forehead.
She took off her hat and made a movement
with her arms as if thrusting away some invisible
assailant. She felt she could not encounter even
Mr. Quincunx in this obsessed condition. She had
the sensation of being infected by some kind of
odious leprosy.</p>

<p>She sat down in the hedge, heedless of the still
clinging dew. Strange and desperate thoughts whirled
through her brain. She longed to purge herself in
some way, to bathe deep, deep,&mdash;body and soul,&mdash;in
some cleansing stream.</p>

<p>But what about Gladys’ betrothed? What about
the American? Vennie had scarcely spoken to
Dangelis, hardly ever seen him, but she felt a wave of
sympathy for the betrayed artist surge through her
heart. It could not be allowed,&mdash;it could not,&mdash;that
those two false intriguers should fool this innocent
gentleman!</p>

<p>Struck by a sudden illumination as if from the
unveiled future, she saw herself going straight to
Dangelis and revealing the whole story. He should
at least be made aware of the real nature of the girl
he was marrying!</p>

<p>Having resolved upon this bold step, Vennie recovered
something of her natural mood. Where was Mr.
Dangelis at this moment? She must find that out,&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>
Mr. Quincunx would know. She must make
a struggle to waylay the artist, to get an interview
with him alone.</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, and holding her hat in her
hand, advanced resolutely up the lane. She felt
happier now, relieved, in a measure, of that odious
sense of confederacy with gross sin which had weighed
her down. But there still beat vaguely in her brain
a passionate longing for purification. If only she
could escape, even for a few hours, from this lust-burdened
spot! If only she could cool her forehead
in the sea!</p>

<p>As she approached Mr. Quincunx’s cottage she experienced
a calm and restorative reaction from her
distress of mind. She felt no longer alone in the
world. Having resolved on a drastic stroke on behalf
of clear issues, she was strangely conscious, as she
had not been conscious for many months, of the
presence, near her and with her, of the Redeemer of
men.</p>

<p>It suddenly was borne in upon her that that other
criminal abuse, which had so long oppressed her soul
with a dead burden,&mdash;the affair of Lacrima and
Goring,&mdash;was intimately associated with what she
had discovered. It was more than likely that by
exposing the one she could prevent the other.</p>

<p>Flushed with excitement at this thought she opened
Mr. Quincunx’s gate and walked up his garden-path.
To her amazement, she heard voices in the cottage
and not only voices, but voices speaking in a language
that vaguely reminded her of the little Catholic
services in the chapel at Yeoborough.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx himself answered her knock and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>
opened the door. He was strangely agitated. The hand
which he extended to her shook as it touched her fingers.</p>

<p>But Vennie herself was too astonished at the sight
which met her eyes to notice anything of this. Seated
opposite one another, on either side of the solitary’s
kitchen-fire, were Lacrima and the little Dolores.
Vennie had interrupted a lively and impassioned
colloquy between the two Italians.</p>

<p>They both rose at her entrance, and their host,
in hurried nervous speech, gave Vennie an incoherent
account of what had happened.</p>

<p>When they were all seated,&mdash;Vennie in the little
girl’s chair, and the child on Mr. Quincunx’s knees,&mdash;the
embarrassment of the first surprise quickly subsided.</p>

<p>“I shall adopt her,” the solitary kept repeating,&mdash;as
though the words were uttered in a defiance of
universal opposition, “I shall adopt her. You’d
advise me to do that, wouldn’t you Miss Seldom?</p>

<p>“I shall get a proper document made out, so that
there can be no mistake. I shall adopt her. Whatever
anyone likes to say, I shall adopt her!</p>

<p>“Those circus-scoundrels will hold their tongues and
let me alone for their own sakes. I shall have no
trouble. Lacrima will explain to the police who
the child is, and who her parents were. That is, if
the police come. But they won’t come. Why should
they come? I shall have a document drawn out.”</p>

<p>It seemed as though the little Neapolitan knew by
instinct what her protector was saying, for she nestled
down against his shoulder and taking one of his hands
in both of hers pressed it against her lips.</p>

<p>Vennie gazed at Lacrima, and Lacrima gazed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span>
Vennie, but neither of them spoke. There was an
inner flame of triumphant concentration in Vennie’s
glance, but Lacrima’s look was clouded and sad.</p>

<p>“Certainly no one will interfere with you,” said
Vennie at last. “We shall all be so glad to think
that the child is in such good hands.</p>

<p>“The only difficulty I can see,” she paused a moment,
while the grey eyes of Mr. Quincunx opened
wide and an expression of something like defiance
passed over his face, “is that it’ll be difficult for you
to know what to do with her while you are away in
Yeoborough. You could hardly leave her alone in
this out-of-the-way place, and I’m afraid our Nevilton
National School wouldn’t suit her at all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx freed his hand and stroked his beard.
His fingers were quivering, and Vennie noticed a
certain curious twitching in the muscles of his face.</p>

<p>“I shan’t go to Yeoborough any more,” he cried.
“None of you need think it!</p>

<p>“That affair is over and done with. I shan’t stay
here, any more, either, to be bullied by the Romers
and made a fool of by all these idiots. I shall go
away. I shall go&mdash;far away&mdash;to London&mdash;to
Liverpool,&mdash;to&mdash;to Norwich,&mdash;like the Man in the
Moon!”</p>

<p>This final inspiration brought a flicker of his old
goblin-humour to the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>Lacrima looked at Vennie with an imperceptible
lifting of her eyebrows, and then sighed deeply.</p>

<p>The latter clasped the arms of her high-backed
chair with firm hands.</p>

<p>“I think it is essential that you should know <em>where</em>
you are going, Mr. Quincunx. I mean for the child’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>
sake. You surely don’t wish to drag her aimlessly
about these great cities while you look for work?</p>

<p>“Besides,&mdash;you won’t be angry will you, if I
speak plainly?&mdash;what work, exactly, have you in
your mind to do? It isn’t, I’m afraid, always easy&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx interrupted her with an outburst of
unexpected fury.</p>

<p>“That’s what I knew you’d say!” he cried in a
loud voice. “That’s what <em>she</em> says.” He indicated
Lacrima. “But you both say it, only because you don’t
want me to have the pleasure of adopting Dolores!</p>

<p>“But I <em>shall</em> adopt her,&mdash;in spite of you all. Yes, in
spite of you all! Nothing shall stop me adopting her!”</p>

<p>Once more the little Italian nestled close against
him, and took possession of his trembling hand.</p>

<p>Vennie perceived an expression of despairing hopelessness
pass like an icy mist over Lacrima’s face.</p>

<p>The profile of the Nevilton nun assumed those lines
of commanding obstinacy which had reminded
Valentia a few hours ago of the mediæval baron.
She rose to her feet.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Mr. Quincunx,” she said sternly.
“You are right; you are quite right, to wish to save
this child. No one shall stop you saving her. No
one shall stop you adopting her. But there are other
people whose happiness depends upon what you do,
besides this child.”</p>

<p>She paused, and glanced from Mr. Quincunx to
Lacrima, and from Lacrima to Mr. Quincunx. Then
a look of indescribable domination and power passed
into her face. She might have been St. Catharine
herself, magnetizing the whole papal court into
obedience to her will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh you foolish people!” she cried, “you foolish
people! Can’t you see where God is leading you?
Can’t you see where His Spirit has brought you?”</p>

<p>She turned upon Mr. Quincunx with shining eyes,
while Lacrima, white as a phantom and with drooping
mouth, watched her in amazement.</p>

<p>“It’s not only this child He’s helped you to save,”
she went on. “It’s not only this child! Are you
blind to what He means? Don’t you understand the
cruelty that is being done to your friend? Don’t
you understand?”</p>

<p>She stretched out her arm and touched Mr. Quincunx’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“You must do more than give this little one a father,”
she murmured in a low tone, “you must give her
a mother. How can she be happy without a mother?</p>

<p>“Come,” she went on, in a voice vibrating with
magnetic authority, “there’s no other way. You and
Lacrima must join hands. You must join hands at
once, and defy everyone. Our little wanderer must
have both father and mother! That is what God
intends.”</p>

<p>There was a long and strange silence, broken only
by the ticking of the clock.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Quincunx slowly rose, allowed the child
to sink down into his empty chair, and crossed over
to Lacrima’s side. Very solemnly, and as if registering
a sacred vow, he took his friend’s head between his
hands and kissed her on the forehead. Then, searching
for her hand and holding it tightly in his own, he
turned towards Vennie, while Lacrima herself, pressing
her face against his shabby coat, broke into convulsive
crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[693]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll take your advice,” he said gravely. “I’ll
take it without question. There are more difficulties
in the way than you know, but I’ll do,&mdash;we’ll do,&mdash;just
what you tell us. I can’t think&mdash;” he hesitated
for a moment, while a curious smile flickered
across his face, “how on earth I’m going to manage.
I can’t think how we’re going to get away from here.
But I’ll take your advice and we’ll do exactly as
you say.</p>

<p>“We’ll do what she says, won’t we, Lacrima?”</p>

<p>Lacrima’s only answer was to conceal her face still
more completely in his dusty coat, but her crying
became quieter and presently ceased altogether.</p>

<p>At that moment there came a sharp knock a the
door.</p>

<p>The countenance of Mr. Quincunx changed. He
dropped his friend’s hand, and moved into the centre
of the room.</p>

<p>“That must be the circus-people,” he whispered.
“They’ve come for Dolores. You’ll support me won’t
you?” He looked imploringly at Vennie. “You’ll
tell them they can’t have her&mdash;that I refuse to give
her up&mdash;that I’m going to adopt her?”</p>

<p>He went out and opened the door.</p>

<p>It was not the circus-men he found waiting on his
threshold. Nor was it the police. It was only one
of the under-gardeners from Nevilton House. The
youth explained that Mr. Romer had sent him to fetch
Lacrima.</p>

<p>“They be goin’ to lunch early, mistress says, and
the young lady ’ave to come right along ’ome wi’ I.”</p>

<p>Vennie intervened at this moment between her
agitated host and the intruder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[694]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll bring Miss Traffio home,” she said sternly,
“when she’s ready to come. You may go back and
tell Mrs. Romer that she’s with me,&mdash;with Miss
Seldom.”</p>

<p>The youth touched his hat, and slouched off,
without further protest.</p>

<p>Vennie, returning into the kitchen, found Mr.
Quincunx standing thoughtfully by the mantelpiece,
stroking his beard, and the two Italians engaged in
an excited conversation in their own tongue.</p>

<p>The descendant of the lords of Nevilton meditated
for a moment with drooping head, her hands characteristically
clasped behind her back. When she
lifted up her chin and began to speak, there was the
same concentrated light in her eyes and the same
imperative tone in her voice.</p>

<p>“The thing for us to do,” she said, speaking hurriedly
but firmly, “is to go&mdash;all four of us&mdash;straight
away from here! I’m not going to leave you until
things are settled. I’m going to get you all clean
out of this,&mdash;clean away!”</p>

<p>She paused and looked at Lacrima. “Where’s Mr.
Dangelis?” she asked.</p>

<p>Lacrima explained how the artist had written to
Gladys that he was staying until the following day at
the Gloucester Hotel in Weymouth.</p>

<p>Vennie’s face became radiant when she heard this.
“Ah!” she cried, “God is indeed fighting for us!
It’s Dangelis that I must see, and see at once. Where
better could we all go,&mdash;at any rate for tonight&mdash;than
to Weymouth? We’ll think later what must be
done next. Dangelis will help us. I’m perfectly
certain he’ll help us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh yes, we’ll go to Weymouth at once,&mdash;before
there’s any risk of the Romers stopping us! We’ll
walk to Yeoborough&mdash;that’ll give us time to think
out our plans&mdash;and take the train from there.</p>

<p>“I’ll send a telegram to my mother late tonight,
when there’s no chance of her communicating with
the House. As to being seen in Yeoborough by any
Nevilton people, we must risk that! God has been
so good to us today that I can’t believe He won’t
go on being good to us.</p>

<p>“Oh what a relief it’ll be,&mdash;what a relief,&mdash;to get
away from Nevilton! And I shall be able to dip my
hands in the sea!”</p>

<p>While these rapid utterances fell from Vennie’s
excited lips, the face of Mr. Quincunx was a wonder
to look upon. It was the crisis of his days, and he
displayed his knowledge that it was so by more
convulsive changes of expression, than perhaps, in
an equal stretch of time, had ever crossed the visage
of a mortal man.</p>

<p>“We’ll take your advice,” he said, at last, with
immense solemnity.</p>

<p>Lacrima looked at him wistfully. Her face was
very pale and her lips trembled.</p>

<p>“It isn’t only because of the child, is it, that he’s
ready to go?” she murmured, clutching at Vennie’s
arm, as Mr. Quincunx retired to make his brief
preparations. “I shouldn’t like to think it was only
that. But he <em>is</em> fond of me. He <em>is</em> fond of me!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">LODMOOR</span></h2>

<p>It was Mr. Quincunx who had to find the money
for their bold adventure. Neither Vennie nor
Lacrima could discover a single penny on their
persons. Mr. Quincunx produced it from the bottom
of an old jam-pot placed in the interior recesses of
one of his deepest cupboards. He displayed to his
three friends, with not a little pride, the sum he was
possessed of,&mdash;no less in fact than five golden
sovereigns.</p>

<p>Their walk to Yeoborough was full of thrilling little
excitements. Three times they concealed themselves
on the further side of the hedge, to let certain suspicious
pedestrians, who might be Nevilton people,
pass by unastonished.</p>

<p>Once well upon their way, they all four felt a
strange sense of liberation and expansion. The little
Neapolitan walked between Mr. Quincunx and Lacrima,
a hand given to each, and her childish high
spirits kept them all from any apprehensive brooding.</p>

<p>Once and once only, they looked back, and Mr.
Quincunx shook his fist at the two distant hills.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he remarked to Vennie, “it’s the
sea we’re in want of. These curst inland fields have
the devil in their heavy mould.”</p>

<p>They found themselves, when they reached the
town, with an hour to spare before their train started,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span>
and entering a little dairy-shop near the station,
they refreshed themselves with milk and bread-and-butter.
Here Mr. Quincunx and the child waited
in excited expectation, while the two girls went
out to make some necessary purchases&mdash;returning
finally, in triumph, with a light wicker-work suit-case,
containing all that they required for several days
and nights.</p>

<p>They were in the train at last, with a compartment
to themselves, and, as far as they could tell, quite
undiscovered by anyone who knew them.</p>

<p>Vennie had hardly ever in her life enjoyed anything
more than she enjoyed that journey. She felt that
the stars were fighting on her side or, to put it in
terms of her religion, that God Himself was smoothing
the road in front of her.</p>

<p>She experienced a momentary pang when the train,
at last, passing along the edge of the back-water,
ran in to Weymouth Station. It was so sweet, so
strangely sweet, to know that three living souls
depended upon her for their happiness, for their
escape from the power of the devil! Would she feel
like this, would she ever feel quite like this, when
the convent-doors shut her away from this exciting
world?</p>

<p>They emerged from the crowded station,&mdash;Mr.
Quincunx carrying the wicker-work suit-case&mdash;and
made their way towards the Esplanade.</p>

<p>The early afternoon sun lay hot upon the pavements,
but from the sea a strong fresh wind was
blowing. Both the girls shivered a little in their
thin frocks, and as the red shawl of the young Italian
had already excited some curiosity among the passers-by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span>
they decided to enter one of the numerous drapery
shops, and spend some more of Mr. Quincunx’s
money.</p>

<p>They were so long in the shop that the nervous
excitement of the recluse was on the point of changing
into nervous irritation, when at last they reappeared.
But he was reconciled to the delay when he perceived
the admirable use they had made of it.</p>

<p>All three were wearing long tweed rain-cloaks of
precisely the same tint of sober grey. They looked
like three sisters, newly arrived from some neighbouring
inland town,&mdash;Dorchester, perhaps, or Sherborne,&mdash;with
a view to spending a pleasant afternoon at
the sea-side. Not only were they all wrapped in
the same species of cloak. They had purchased three
little woollen caps of a similar shade, such things as
it would have been difficult to secure in any shop
but a little unfashionable one, where summer and
winter vogues casually overlapped.</p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx, whose exaltation of mood had not
made him forget to bring his own overcoat with him,
now put this on, and warmly and comfortably clad,
the four fugitives from Nevilton strolled along the
Esplanade in the direction of St. John’s church.</p>

<p>To leave his three companions free to run down to
the sea’s edge, Mr. Quincunx possessed himself of
the clumsy paper parcels containing the hats they
had relinquished and also of the little girl’s red shawl,
and resting on a seat with these objects piled up by
his side he proceeded to light a cigarette and gaze
placidly about him. The worst of his plunge into
activity being over,&mdash;for, whatever happened, the
initial effort was bound to be the worst,&mdash;the wanderer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
from Dead Man’s Lane chuckled to himself with
bursts of cynical humour as he contemplated the
situation they were in.</p>

<p>But what a relief it was to see the clear-shining
foam-sprinkled expanse of water lying spread out
before him! Like the younger Andersen, Mr. Quincunx
had a passionate love of Weymouth, and never
had he loved it more than he did at that moment!
He greeted the splendid curve of receding cliffs&mdash;the
White Nore and St. Alban’s Head&mdash;with a sigh
of profound satisfaction, and he looked across to the
massive bulk of Portland, as though in its noble
uncrumbling stone&mdash;stone that was so much nearer
to marble than to clay&mdash;there lurked some occult
talisman ready to save him from everything connected
with Leo’s Hill.</p>

<p>Yes, the sea was what he wanted just then! How
well the salt taste of it, the smell of its sun-bleached
stranded weeds, its wide horizons, its long-drawn
murmur, blent with the strange new mood into which
that morning’s events had thrown him!</p>

<p>How happy the little Dolores looked, between
Lacrima and Vennie, her dark curls waving in the
wind from beneath her grey cap!</p>

<p>All at once his mind reverted to James Andersen,
lying now alone and motionless, under six feet of
yellow clay. Mr. Quincunx shivered. After all it
was something to be alive still, something to be still
able to stroke one’s beard and stretch one’s legs,
and fumble in one’s pocket for a “Three Castles”
cigarette!</p>

<p>He wondered vaguely how and when this young
St. Catharine of theirs intended to marry him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
Lacrima. And then what? Would he have to work
frightfully, preposterously hard?</p>

<p>He chuckled to himself to think how blank Mr.
Romer would look, when he found that both his
victims had been spirited away in one breath. What
a girl this Vennie Seldom was!</p>

<p>He tried to imagine what it would be like, this
business of being married. After all, he was very
fond of Lacrima. He hoped that dusky wavy hair
of hers were as long as it suggested that it was! He
liked girls to have long hair.</p>

<p>Would she bring him his tea in the morning,
sometimes, with bare arms and bare feet? Would
she sit cross-legged at the foot of his bed, while he
drank it, and chatter to him of what they would do
when he came back from his work?</p>

<p><em>His work!</em> That was an aspect of the affair which
certainly might well be omitted.</p>

<p>And then, as he stared at the three girlish figures
on the beach, there came over him the strange illusion
that both Vennie and Lacrima were only dream-people&mdash;unreal
and fantastic&mdash;and that the true
living persons of his drama were himself and his little
Neapolitan waif.</p>

<p>Suppose the three girls were to take a boat&mdash;one
of those boats whose painted keels he saw glittering
now so pleasantly on the beach&mdash;and row out into
the water. And suppose the boat were upset and
both Vennie and Lacrima drowned? Would he be
so sad to have to live the rest of his life alone with
the little Dolores?</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be better if this event occurred
after Vennie had helped him to secure some work to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span>
do&mdash;some not too hard work! Well&mdash;Vennie, at
any rate, <em>was</em> going to be drowned in a certain sense,
at least she was meditating entering a convent, and
that was little different from being drowned, or being
buried in yellow clay, like James Andersen!</p>

<p>But Lacrima was not meditating entering a convent.
Lacrima was meditating being married to
him, and being a mother to their adopted child. He
hoped she would be a gentle mother. If she were
not, if she ever spoke crossly to Dolores, he would
lose his temper. He would lose his temper so much
that he would tremble from head to foot! He called
up an imaginary scene between them, a scene so
vivid that he found himself trembling now, as his
hand rested upon the paper parcel.</p>

<p>But perhaps, if by chance they left England and
went on a journey,&mdash;Witch-Bessie had found a
journey, “a terrible journey,” in the lines of his
hand,&mdash;Lacrima would catch a fever in some foreign
city, and he and Dolores would be left alone, quite
as alone as if she were drowned today!</p>

<p>But perhaps it would be he, Maurice Quincunx,
who would catch the fever. No! He did not like
these “terrible journeys.” He preferred to sit on a
seat on Weymouth Esplanade and watch Dolores
laughing and running into the sea and picking up
shells.</p>

<p>The chief thing was to be alive, and not too tired,
or too cold, or too hungry, or too harassed by insolent
aggressive people! How delicious a thing life
could be if it were only properly arranged! If cruelty,
and brutality, and vulgarity, and <em>office-work</em>, were
removed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[702]</a></span></p>

<p>He could never be cruel to anyone. From that
worst sin,&mdash;if one could talk of such a thing as sin
in this mad world,&mdash;his temperament entirely saved
him. He hoped when they were married that Lacrima
would not want him to be too sentimental
about her. And he rather hoped that he would still
have his evenings to himself, to turn over the pages
of Rabelais, when he had kissed Dolores good night.</p>

<p>His meditations were interrupted at this point by
the return of his companions, who came scrambling
across the shingle, threading their way among the
boats, laughing and talking merrily, and trailing long
pieces of sea-weed in their hands.</p>

<p>Vennie announced that since it was nearly four
o’clock it would be advisable for them to secure their
lodging for the night, and when that was done she
would leave them to their own devices for an hour
or two, while she proceeded to the Gloucester Hotel
to have her interview with Ralph Dangelis.</p>

<p>Their various sea-spoils being all handed over to
the excited little foundling, they walked slowly along
the Esplanade, still bearing to the east, while they
surveyed the appearance of the various “crescents,”
“terraces,” and “rows” on the opposite side of the
street. It was not till they arrived at the very end
of these, that Vennie, who had assumed complete
responsibility for their movements, piloted them
across the road.</p>

<p>The houses they now approached were entitled
“Brunswick Terrace,” and they entirely fulfilled their
title by suggesting, in the pleasant liberality of their
bay-windows and the mellow dignity of their well-proportioned
fronts, the sort of solid comfort which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[703]</a></span>
the syllables “Brunswick” seem naturally to convey.
They began their enquiries for rooms, about five
doors from the end of the terrace, but it was not till
they reached the last house,&mdash;the last except two
reddish-coloured ones of later date,&mdash;that they
found what they wanted.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the two Italians should share
a room together. Vennie elected to sleep in a small
apartment adjoining theirs, while Mr. Quincunx was
given a front-room, looking out on the sea, on the
third floor.</p>

<p>Vennie smiled to herself as she thought how amazed
her mother would have been could she have seen her
at that moment, as she helped Lacrima to unpack
their solitary piece of luggage, while Mr. Quincunx
smoked cigarettes in the balcony of the window!</p>

<p>She left them finally in the lodging-house parlour,
seated on a horse-hair sofa, watching the prim landlady
preparing tea. Vennie refused to wait for this
meal, being anxious&mdash;she said&mdash;to get her interview
with the American well over, for until that moment
had been reached, she could neither discuss their
future plans calmly, nor enjoy the flavour of the
adventure.</p>

<p>When Vennie had left them, and the three were all
comfortably seated round the table, Mr. Quincunx
found Lacrima in so radiant a mood that he began
to feel a little ashamed of his ambiguous meditations
on the Esplanade. She was, after all, quite beautiful
in her way,&mdash;though, of course, not as beautiful
as the young Neapolitan, whose eyes had a look in
them, even when she was happy, which haunted one
and filled one with vague indescribable emotions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Quincunx himself was in the best of spirits.
His beard wagged, his nostrils quivered, his wit
flowed. Lacrima fixed her eyes upon him with delighted
appreciation,&mdash;and led him on and on,
through a thousand caprices of fancy. The poor
Pariah’s heart was full of exquisite happiness. She
felt like one actually liberated from the tomb. For
the first time since she had known anything of England
she was able to breathe freely and spontaneously
and be her natural self.</p>

<p>For some queer reason or other, her thoughts kept
reverting to James Andersen, but reverting to him
with neither sadness nor pity. She felt no remorse
for not having been present when he was buried that
morning. She did not feel as though he were buried.
She did not feel as though he were dead. She felt,
in some strange way, that he had merely escaped from
the evil spells of Nevilton, and that in the power of
his new strength he was the cause of her own
emancipation.</p>

<p>And what an emancipation it was! It was like suddenly
becoming a child again&mdash;a child with power
to enjoy the very things that children so often miss.</p>

<p>Everything in this little parlour pleased her. The
blue vases on the mantelpiece containing dusty
“everlasting flowers,” the plush-framed portraits of
the landlady’s deceased parents, enlarged to a magnitude
of shadowy dignity by some old-fashioned
photographic process, the quaint row of minute
china elephants that stood on a little bracket in the
corner, the glaring antimacassar thrown across the
back of the arm-chair, the sea-scents and sea-murmurs
floating in through the window, the melodious crying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[705]</a></span>
of a fish-pedler in the street; all these things thrilled
her with a sense of freedom and escape, which over-brimmed
her heart with happiness.</p>

<p>What matter, after all, she thought, that her little
compatriot with the wonderful eyes had been the
means of arousing her friend from his inertia! Her
long acquaintance with Mr. Quincunx had mellowed
her affection for him into a tenderness that was
almost maternal. She could even find it in her to
be glad that she was to be saved from the burden of
struggling alone with his fits of melancholia. With
Dolores to keep him amused, and herself to look after
his material wants, it seemed probable that, whatever
happened, the dear man would be happier than
he had ever dreamed of being!</p>

<p>The uncertainty of their future weighed upon her
very little. She had the true Pariah tendency to
lie back with arms outstretched upon the great tide,
and let it carry her whither it pleased. She had done
this so long, while the tide was dark and evil, that
to do it where the waters gleamed and shone was a
voluptuous delight.</p>

<p>While her protégées were thus enjoying themselves
Vennie sought out and entered, with a resolute bearing,
the ancient Gloucester Hotel. The place had
recently been refitted according to modern notions
of comfort, but in its general lines, and in a certain
air it had of liberal welcoming, it preserved the
Georgian touch.</p>

<p>She was already within the hall-way when, led by an
indefinable impulse to look back, she caught sight of
Dangelis himself walking rapidly along the Esplanade
towards the very quarter from which she had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[706]</a></span>
come. Without a moment’s hesitation she ran down
the steps, crossed the road and followed him.</p>

<p>The American seemed to be inspired by some mania
for fast walking that afternoon. Vennie was quite
breathless before she succeeded in approaching him,
and she did not manage to do this until they were
both very nearly opposite Brunswick Terrace.</p>

<p>Just here she was unwilling to make herself known,
as her friends might at any moment emerge from their
lodging. She preferred to follow the long strides of
the artist still further, till, in fact he had led her,
hot and exhausted in her new cloak, quite beyond the
limits of the houses.</p>

<p>Where the town ceases, on this eastern side, a long
white dusty road leads across a mile or two of level
ground before the noble curve of cliffs ending in St.
Alban’s Head has its beginning. This road is bounded
on one hand by a high bank of shingle and on the
other by a wide expanse of salt-marshes known in
that district under the name of Lodmoor. It was
not until the American had emerged upon this solitary
road that his pursuer saw fit to bring him to
a halt.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dangelis!” she called out, “Mr. Dangelis!”</p>

<p>He swung round in astonishment at hearing his
name. For the first moment he did not recognize
Vennie. Her newly purchased attire,&mdash;not to speak
of her unnaturally flushed cheeks,&mdash;had materially
altered her appearance. When she held out her hand,
however, and stopped to take breath, he realized
who she was.</p>

<p>“Oh Mr. Dangelis,” she gasped, “I’ve been following
you all the way from the Hotel. I so want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[707]</a></span>
talk to you. You <em>must</em> listen to me. It’s very, very
important!”</p>

<p>He held his hat in his hand, and regarded her with
smiling amazement.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Seldom, you <em>are</em> an astonishing person.
Is your mother here? Are you staying at Weymouth?
How did you catch sight of me? Certainly&mdash;by all
means&mdash;tell me your news! I long to hear this thing
that’s so important.”</p>

<p>He made as if he would return with her to the
town, but she laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no! let’s walk on quietly here. I can talk
to you better here.”</p>

<p>The roadway, however, proved so disconcerting,
owing to great gusts of wind which kept driving the
sand and dust along its surface, that before Vennie had
summoned up courage to begin her story, they found
it necessary to debouch to their left and enter the
marshy flats of Lodmoor. They took their way along
the edge of a broad ditch, whose black peat-bottomed
waters were overhung by clumps of “Michaelmas
daisies” and sprinkled with weird glaucous-leafed
plants. It was a place of a singular character, owing
to the close encounter in it of land and sea, and it
seemed to draw the appeal of its strange desolation
almost equally from both these sources.</p>

<p>Vennie, on the verge of speaking, found her senses
in a state of morbid alertness. Everything she felt
and saw at that moment lodged itself with poignant
sharpness in her brain and returned to her mind long
afterwards. So extreme was her nervous tension that
she found it difficult to disentangle her thoughts from
all these outward impressions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[708]</a></span></p>

<p>The splash of a water-rat became an episode in
her suspended revelation. The bubbles rising from
the movements of an eel in the mud got mixed with
the image of Mrs. Wotnot picking laurel-leaves. The
flight of a sea-gull above their heads was a projection
of Dangelis’ escape from the spells of his false mistress.
The wind shaking the reeds was the breath of
her fatal news ruffling the man’s smiling attention.
The wail of the startled plovers was the cry of her own
heart, calling upon all the spirits of truth and justice,
to make him believe her words.</p>

<p>She told him at last,&mdash;told him everything, walking
slowly by his side with her eyes cast down and her
hands clasped tight behind her.</p>

<p>When she had finished, there was an immense
intolerable silence, and slowly, very slowly, she
permitted her glance to rise to her companion’s
face, to grasp the effect of her narration upon
him.</p>

<p>How rare it is that these world-shaking revelations
produce the impression one has anticipated! To
Vennie’s complete amazement,&mdash;and even, it must
be allowed, a little to her dismay,&mdash;Dangelis regarded
her with a frank untroubled smile.</p>

<p>“You,&mdash;I&mdash;” she stammered, and stopped
abruptly. Then, before he could answer her, “I
didn’t know you knew all this. Did you really know
it,&mdash;and not mind? Don’t people mind these things
in&mdash;in other countries?”</p>

<p>Dangelis spoke at last. “Oh, yes of course, we
mind as much as any of you; that is to say, if we
<em>do</em> mind,&mdash;but you must remember, Miss Seldom,
there are circumstances, situations,&mdash;there are, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span>
fact feelings,&mdash;which make these things sometimes
rather a relief than otherwise!”</p>

<p>He threw up his stick in the air, as he spoke, and
caught it as it descended.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, one moment, I want&mdash;I want to
see if I can jump this ditch.”</p>

<p>He threw both stick and hat on the ground, and
to Vennie’s complete amazement, stepped back a
pace or two, and running desperately to the brink
of the stream cleared it with a bound. He repeated
this manœuvre from the further bank, and returned,
breathing hard and fast, to the girl’s side.</p>

<p>Picking up his hat and stick, he uttered a wild
series of barbaric howls, such howls as Vennie had
never, in her life, heard issuing from the mouth of
man or beast. Had Gladys’ treachery turned his
brain?</p>

<p>But no madman could possibly have smiled the
friendly boyish smile with which he greeted her when
this performance was over.</p>

<p>“So sorry if I scared you,” he said. “Do you
know what that is? It’s our college ‘yell.’ It’s what
we do at base-ball matches.”</p>

<p>Vennie thought he was going to do it again, and in
her apprehension she laid a hand on his sleeve.</p>

<p>“But don’t you really mind Miss Romer’s being like
this? Did you know she was like this?” she enquired.</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s think about her any more,” cried the
artist. “I don’t care what she’s like, now I can get
rid of her. To tell you the honest truth, Miss Seldom,
I’d come down here for no other reason than
to think over this curst hole I’ve got myself into,
and to devise some way out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[710]</a></span></p>

<p>“What you tell me,&mdash;and I believe every word of
it, I want to believe every word of it!&mdash;just gives
me the excuse I need. Good-bye, Miss Gladys!
Good-bye, Ariadne! ‘Ban-ban, Ca-Caliban, Have a
new master, get a new man!’ No more engagements
for me, dear Miss Seldom! I’m a free lance now, a
free lance,&mdash;henceforward and forever!”</p>

<p>The exultant artist was on the point of indulging
once more in his college yell, but the scared and
bewildered expression on Vennie’s face saved her from
a second experience of that phenomenon.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you what I was thinking of doing,
as I strolled along the Front this afternoon?”</p>

<p>Vennie nodded, unable to repress a smile as she remembered
the difficulty she had in arresting this stroll.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of taking the boat for the Channel
Islands tomorrow! I even went so far as to make
enquiries about the time it started. What do you
think of that?”</p>

<p>Vennie thought it was extremely singular, and she
also thought that she had never heard the word
“enquiries” pronounced in just that way.</p>

<p>“It leaves quite early, at nine in the morning. And
it’s <em>some</em> boat,&mdash;I can tell you that!”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Vennie, recovering by degrees
that sense of concentrated power which had accompanied
her all day, “what now? Are you still going
to sail by it?”</p>

<p>“That’s&mdash;a&mdash;large&mdash;proposition,” answered her
interlocutor slowly. “I&mdash;I rather think I am!”</p>

<p>One effect of his escape from his Nevilton enchantress
seemed to be an irrepressible tendency to relapse
into the American vernacular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span></p>

<p>They continued advancing along the edge of the
ditch, side by side.</p>

<p>Vennie plunged into the matter of Lacrima and
Mr. Quincunx.</p>

<p>She narrated all she knew of this squalid and sinister
story. She enlarged upon the two friends’ long
devotion to one another. She pictured the wickedness
and shame of the projected marriage with John
Goring. Finally she explained how it had come about
that both Mr. Romer’s slaves, and with them the
little circus-waif, were at that moment in Weymouth.</p>

<p>“And so you’ve carried them off?” cried the Artist
in high glee. “Bless my soul, but I admire you for
it! And what are you going to do with them now?”</p>

<p>Vennie looked straight into his eyes. “That is
where I want <em>your</em> help, Mr. Dangelis!”</p>

<p>It was late in the evening before the citizen of
Toledo, Ohio, and the would-be Postulant of the
Sacred Heart parted from one another opposite the
Jubilee Clock.</p>

<p>A reassuring telegram had been sent to Mrs. Seldom
announcing Vennie’s return in the course of the following
day.</p>

<p>As for the rest, all had been satisfactorily arranged.
The American had displayed overpowering generosity.
He seemed anxious to do penance for his obsession
by the daughter, by lavishing benefactions upon the
victims of the father. Perhaps it seemed to him that
this was the best manner of paying back the debt,
which his æsthetic imagination owed to the suggestive
charms of the Nevilton landscape.</p>

<p>He made himself, in a word, completely responsible
for the three wanderers. He would carry them off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[712]</a></span>
with him to the Channel Isles, and either settle them
down there, or make it possible for them to cross
thence to France, and from France, if so they pleased,
on to Lacrima’s home in Italy. He would come to
an arrangement with his bankers to have handed over
definitely to Mr. Quincunx a sum that would once
and for all put him into a position of financial
security.</p>

<p>“I’d have paid a hundred times as much as that,”
he laughingly assured Vennie, “to have got clear of
my mix-up with that girl.”</p>

<p>Thus it came about that at nine o’clock on the day
which followed the burial of James Andersen, Vennie,
standing on the edge of the narrow wharf, between
railway-trucks and hawsers, watched the ship with the
red funnels carry off the persons who&mdash;under Heaven&mdash;were
the chief cause of the stone-carver’s death.</p>

<p>As the four figures, waving to her over the ship’s
side grew less and less distinct, Vennie felt an extraordinary
and unaccountable desire to burst into a fit
of passionate weeping. She could not have told why
she wept, nor could she have told whether her tears
were tears of relief or of desolation, but something in
the passing of that brightly-painted ship round the
corner of the little break-water, gave her a different
emotion from any she had ever known in her life.</p>

<p>When at last she turned her back to the harbour,
she asked the way to the nearest Catholic Church,
but in place of following the directions given her, she
found herself seated on the shingles below Brunswick
Terrace, watching the in-drawing and out-flowing
waves.</p>

<p>How strange this human existence was! Long after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[713]</a></span>
the last block of Leonian stone had been removed
from its place&mdash;long after the stately pinnacles of
Nevilton House had crumbled into shapeless ruins,&mdash;long
after the memory of all these people’s troubles
had been erased and forgotten,&mdash;this same tide would
fling itself upon this same beach, and its voice then
would be as its voice now, restless, unsatisfied,
unappeased.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GOAT AND BOY</span></h2>

<p>It was the middle of October. Francis Taxater
and Luke Andersen sat opposite one another
over a beer-stained table in the parlour of the
Goat and Boy. The afternoon was drawing to its
close and the fire in the little grate threw a warm
ruddy light through the darkening room.</p>

<p>Outside the rain was falling, heavily, persistently,&mdash;the
sort of rain that by long-continued importunity
finds its way through every sort of obstacle. For
nearly a month this rain had lasted. It had come in
with the equinox, and Heaven knew how long it was
going to stay. It had so thoroughly drenched all
the fields, woods, lanes, gardens and orchards of
Nevilton, that a palpable atmosphere of charnel-house
chilliness pervaded everything. Into this
atmosphere the light sank at night like a thing
drowned in deep water, and into this atmosphere the
light rose at dawn like something rising from beneath
the sea.</p>

<p>The sun itself, as a definite presence, had entirely
disappeared. It might have fallen into fathomless
space, for all the visible signs it gave of its existence.
The daylight seemed a pallid entity, diffused through
the lower regions of the air, unconnected with any
visible fount of life or warmth.</p>

<p>The rain seemed to draw forth from the earth all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span>
the accumulated moisture of centuries of damp
autumns, while between the water below the firmament
and the water above the firmament,&mdash;between
the persistent deluge from the sky and the dampness
exuded from the earth,&mdash;the death-stricken multitudinous
leaves of Nevilton drifted to their morgue
in the cart-ruts and ditches.</p>

<p>The only object in the vicinity whose appearance
seemed to suffer no change from this incursion of
many waters was Leo’s Hill. Leo’s Hill looked as
if it loved the rain, and the rain looked as if it loved
Leo’s Hill. In no kind of manner were its familiar
outlines affected, except perhaps in winning a certain
added weight, by reason of the fact that its rival
Mount had been stripped of its luxuriant foliage.</p>

<p>“So our dear Mr. Romer has got his Freight Bill
through,” said Luke, sipping his glass of whiskey
and smiling at Mr. Taxater. “He at any rate then
won’t be worried by this rain.”</p>

<p>“I’m to dine with him tomorrow,” answered the
papal champion, “so I shall have an opportunity of
discovering what he’s actually gained by this.”</p>

<p>“I wish I’d had James cremated,” muttered Luke,
staring at the fire-place, into which the rain fell down
the narrow chimney.</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater crossed himself.</p>

<p>“What do you really feel,” enquired the younger
man abruptly, “about the chances in favour of a life
after death?”</p>

<p>“The Church,” answered Mr. Taxater, stirring his
rum and sugar with a spoon, “could hardly be
expected to formulate a dogma denying such a hope.
The true spirit of her attitude towards it may perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span>
be best understood in the repetition of her
requiem prayer, ‘Save us from eternal death!’ We
none of us want eternal death, my friend, though
many of us are very weary of this particular life. I
do not know that I am myself, however. But that
may be due to the fact that I am a real sceptic. To
love life, Andersen, one cannot be too sceptical.”</p>

<p>“Upon my soul I believe you!” answered the stone-carver,
“but I cannot quite see how <em>you</em> can make
claim to that title.”</p>

<p>“You’re not a philosopher my friend,” said Mr.
Taxater, leaning his elbows on the table and fixing
a dark but luminous eye upon his interlocutor.</p>

<p>“If you were a philosopher you would know that
to be a true sceptic it is necessary to be a Catholic.
You, for instance, aren’t a sceptic, and never can be.
You’re a dogmatic materialist. You doubt everything
in the world except doubt. I doubt doubt.”</p>

<p>Luke rose and poked the fire.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid my little Annie’ll be frightfully wet,”
he remarked, “when she gets home tonight. I wish
that last train from Yeoborough wasn’t quite so late.”</p>

<p>“Do you propose to go down to the station to
meet her?” enquired Mr. Taxater.</p>

<p>Luke sighed. “I suppose so,” he said. “That’s the
worst of being married. There’s always something
or other interfering with the main purpose of life.”</p>

<p>“May I ask what the main purpose of life may be?”
said the theologian.</p>

<p>“Talking with you, of course,” replied the young
man smiling; “talking with any friend. Oh damn! I
can’t tell you how I miss going up to Dead Man’s
Cottage.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[717]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said the great scholar meditatively, “women
are bewitching creatures, especially when they’re very
young or very old, but they aren’t exactly arresting
in conversation.”</p>

<p>Luke became silent, meditating on this.</p>

<p>“They throw out little things now and then,” he
said. “Annie does. But they’ve no sense of proportion.
If they’re happy they’re thrilled by everything,
and if they’re unhappy,&mdash;well, you know how it is!
They don’t bite at the truth, for the sake of biting,
and they never get to the bone. They just lick the
gloss of things with the tips of their tongues. And
they quiver and vibrate so, you never know where
they are, or what they’ve got up their sleeve that
tickles them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater lifted his glass to his mouth and carefully
replaced it on the table. There was something
in this movement of his plump white fingers which
always fascinated Luke. Mr. Taxater’s hands looked
as though, beyond the pen and the wine-cup, they never
touched any earthly object.</p>

<p>“Have you heard any more of Philip Wone?”
enquired the stone-carver.</p>

<p>The theologian shook his head. “I’m afraid,
since he went up to London, he’s really got entangled
in these anarchist plots.”</p>

<p>“I’m not unselfish enough to be an anarchist,”
said Luke, “but I sympathize with their spirit. The
sort of people I can’t stand are these Christian Socialists.
What really pleases me, I suppose, is the notion
of a genuine aristocracy, an aristocracy as revolutionary
as anarchists in their attitude to morals and
such things, an aristocracy that’s flung up out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[718]</a></span>
this mad world, as a sort of exquisite flower of chance
and accident, an aristocracy that is <em>worth</em> all this
damned confusion!”</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater smiled. It always amused him when
Luke Andersen got excited in this way, and began
catching his breath and gesticulating. He seemed
to have heard these remarks on other occasions. He
regarded them as a signal that the stone-carver had
drunk more whiskey than was good for him. When
completely himself Luke talked of girls and of death.
When a little depressed he abused either Nonconformists
or Socialists. When in the early stages of
intoxication he eulogized the upper classes.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity,” said the theologian, “that Ninsy
couldn’t bring herself to marry that boy. There’s
something morbid in the way she talks. I met her
in Nevil’s Gully yesterday, and I had quite a long
conversation with her.”</p>

<p>Luke looked sharply at him. “Have you yourself
ever seen her, across there?” he asked making a
gesture in the direction of the churchyard.</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater shook his head. “Have you?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>Luke nodded.</p>

<p>A sudden silence fell upon them. The rain beat in
redoubled fury upon the window, and they could
hear it pattering on the roof and falling in a heavy
stream from the pipe above the eaves.</p>

<p>The younger man felt as though some tragic intimation,
uttered in a tongue completely beyond the reach
of both of them, were beating about for entry, at
closed shutters.</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater felt no sensation of this kind. “<i>Non<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[719]</a></span>
est reluctandum cum Deo</i>” were the sage words with
which he raised his glass to his lips.</p>

<p>Luke remained motionless staring at the window,
and thinking of a certain shrouded figure, with hollow
cheeks and crossed hands, to whom this rain was
nothing, and less than nothing.</p>

<p>Once more there was silence between them, as
though a flock of noiseless night-birds were flying
over the house, on their way to the far-off sea.</p>

<p>“How is Mrs. Seldom getting on?” enquired Luke,
pushing back his chair. “Is Vennie allowed to write
to her from that place?”</p>

<p>The theologian smiled. “Oh, the dear lady is perfectly
happy! In fact, I think she’s really happier
than when she was worrying herself about Vennie’s
future.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like these convents,” remarked Luke.</p>

<p>“Few people like them,” said the papal champion,
“who have never entered them.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen an unhappy nun. They are
almost too happy. They are like children. Perhaps
they’re the only persons in existence who know what
continual, as opposed to spasmodic, happiness means.
The happiness of sanctity is a secret that has to be
concealed from the world, just as the happiness of
certain very vicious people has,&mdash;for fear there
should be no more marriages.”</p>

<p>“Talking of marriages,” remarked Luke, “I’d give
anything to know how our friend Gladys is getting
on with Clavering. I expect his attitude of heroic
pity has worn a little thin by this time. I wonder
how soon the more earthly side of the shield will
wear thin too! But&mdash;poor dear girl!&mdash;I do feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[720]</a></span>
sorry for her. Fancy having to listen to the Reverend
Hugh’s conversation by night and by day!</p>

<p>“I sent her a picture post-card, the other afternoon,
from Yeoborough&mdash;a comic one. I wonder if
she snapped it up, and hid it, before her husband
came down to breakfast!”</p>

<p>The jeering tone of the man jarred a little on
Mr. Taxater’s nerves.</p>

<p>“I think I understand,” he thought to himself,
“why it is that he praises the aristocracy.”</p>

<p>To change the conversation, he reverted to Miss
Seldom’s novitiate.</p>

<p>“Vennie was very indignant with me for remaining
so long in London, but I am glad now that I did.
None of our little arrangements&mdash;eh, my friend?&mdash;would
have worked out so well as her Napoleonic
directness. That shows how wise it is to stand aside
sometimes and let things take their course.”</p>

<p>“Romer doesn’t stand aside,” laughed Luke. “I’d
give a year of my life to know what he felt when
Dangelis carried those people away! But I suppose
we shall never know.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it’s possible that there’s any truth in
that strange idea of Vennie’s that Leo’s Hill has a
definite evil power over this place? Upon my soul
I’m almost inclined to wish it has! God, how it
does rain!”</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. “I shall have to go down
to the station in a minute,” he remarked.</p>

<p>One curious feature of this conversation between
the two men was that there began to grow up a deep
and vague irritation in Mr. Taxater’s mind against
his companion. Luke’s tone when he alluded to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">[721]</a></span>
picture-card&mdash;“a comic one”&mdash;struck him as touching
a depth of cynical inhumanity.</p>

<p>The theologian could not help thinking of that gorgeous-coloured
image of the wayward girl, represented
as Ariadne, which now hung in the entrance-hall of
her father’s house. He recalled the magnificent pose
of the figure, and its look of dreamy exultation.
Somehow, the idea of this splendid heathen creature
being the wife of Clavering struck his mind as a revolting
incongruity. For such a superb being to be
now stretching out hopeless arms towards her Nevilton
lover,&mdash;an appeal only answered by comic
post-cards,&mdash;struck his imagination as a far bitterer
commentary upon the perversity of the world than
that disappearance of Vennie into a convent which
seemed so to shock Luke.</p>

<p>He extended his legs and fumbled with the gold
cross upon his watch-chain. He seemed so clearly
to visualize the sort of look which must now be
settling down on that pseudo-priest’s ascetic face.
He gave way to an immoral wish that Clavering
might take to drink. He felt as though he
would sooner have seen Gladys fallen to the streets
than thus made the companion of a monkish
apostate.</p>

<p>He wondered how on earth it had been managed
that Mr. Romer had remained ignorant of the cause
of Dangelis’ flight and the girl’s precipitate marriage.
It was inconceivable that he should be aware of
these things and yet retain this imperturbable young
man in his employment. How craftily Gladys must
have carried the matter through! Well,&mdash;she was
no doubt paying the penalty of her double-dyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[722]</a></span>
deceptions now. The theologian experienced a sick
disgust with the whole business.</p>

<p>The rain increased in violence. It seemed as though
the room where they sat was isolated from the whole
world by a flood of down-pouring waves. The gods
of the immense Spaces were weeping, and man, in his
petty preoccupation, could only mutter and stare.</p>

<p>Luke rose to his feet. “To Romer and his Stone-Works,”
he cried, emptying his glass at one gulp
down his throat, “and may he make me their
Manager!”</p>

<p>Mr. Taxater also rose. “To the tears that wash
away all these things,” he said, “and the Necessity
that was before them and will be after them.”</p>

<p>They went out of the house together, and the
silence that fell between them was like the silence
at the bottom of deep waters.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
